 Comme convenu par téléphone, merci d’appliquer le plan d’action suivant :
 
1-            Arrêtez le serveur et effectuez un Power cycle :

 
a)      Enlever tous les périphériques branchés sur le serveur, même les alimentations.

b)      Rester appuyer sur le bouton power 30 secondes.

c)       Rebrancher tous et redémarrer le serveur.

 

2-      Téléchargez et gravez le fichier ISO de mises à jours : https://dell.app.box.com/bootableR320

 

3-      Bootez sur le DVD et appliquez les mises à jour en choisissant la première option.

28170,115252,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hi Lamees,
Thanks for contacting Efficient iP Support Team.

You have raised a question about the responses received from server 193.188.97.210 when resolving domain yesbank.in

The information you provided is not enough to clear understand the situation. I will need to know the following complimentary information:

1- What is the IP from where the tests (those nslookup queries) were done, a SOLIDserver or a regular PC?

2- You used three servers: 193.188.97.210, 193.188.97.193 and 193.188.97.211. Are all of them SOLIDservers? What are their roles?

3- When you say that ""... is resolvable using public DNS servers"". What servers are you referring to?

4- Do you have implemented some specific configuration for that domain (like forwarding, etc.)?
Because, I tested querying 193.188.97.193, which is ns3.batelco.com.bh and one of the mentioned servers, and I received results that are not consistent:

[193.188.97.193] returned a non-authoritative response in 250 ms:

What do you think the reason, why it was not resolving?

Regards,

Lamees",public,lamees.jasim@btc.com.bh
28170,115327,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hi Lamees,

Thanks for this update, highly appreciated.

Considering the results and that the situation is not permanent, I think it was probably related to some network issue along the path of resolution to reach yesbank.in servers. In that case, it is an external problem. Nevertheless is just a guess, because there is not enough information to be sure, and any test can be done only when the problem is actively present.

If in the future something similar happens, the best test to do is the following:
1- Logging to your DNS cache servers (cust-cache1, cust-cache2) via SSH
2- Open a shell session: Tools > Start a shell
3- Run the following command:
# dig @0 yesbank.in; dig @0 yesbank.in +trace

There I'm actually running two commands but I condensed in one line to make the use easier.

That should be done in the two cache servers and the results could point what is the problem exactly.

Notice that I'm intentionally not using nslookup for the tests, because that doesn't offer the details required for a troubleshooting. On the other hand, dig does.

Having all this, I will close the ticket since the problem is not present anymore. You may save this procedure and use it if the situation happens again. If so, do not hesitate to open a new ticket and provide the results obtained from the test here outlined.

I look forward to your confirmation to close this.

As recommended by EIP, we need to install ISC security . This version has snmp correction included, so we just need to make standard upgrade; no need to apply HF.
Please let us know:
- Is this patch will affect the service? Is there any downtime?
- From your experience, do we need to install the patch in all servers at a time or apply it one by one? and how long the process will take?
- Is it possible to be available with us through webex during the update?
- Provide the documentation.

28230,120337,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hi Lamees,

Sorry for this delay response. Regarding the questions, in general terms, there is no outstanding issue to be taken into account for the upgrade processes on your systems; it's the regular process described in our documentation, SOLIDserver Administrator Guide (see Ch.91 Upgrading, section ""Upgrading Appliances Managed Remotely"" of Ch.84 and section ""Upgrading Appliances in High Availability"" of Ch.83). And in this particular case, yes, the most recent release has corrected the issue re SNMP data, so there is no need to apply the hotfix previously issued. Current latest version in your branch is 5.0.4.P2k 

Considering this, please find below the answers and comments to the questions:

- Is this patch will affect the service? Is there any downtime?

R/ Yes, as all upgrade process there is a small downtime because the system needs to reboot when finishing the upgrade, it is the last step.


- From your experience, do we need to install the patch in all servers at a time or apply it one by one? and how long the process will take?

R/ It is not recommended to do all upgrades at same time, should be done first management appliances and then service (DNS) appliances. It is recommended to schedule the upgrade of service appliances in a sequence that allows enough time to verify each system before starting with the next one, for example a margin of one day.

We cannot estimate how long the process will take because that depends of each implementation, the hardware setting of each appliance and their actual role.

These are the general advices we have, but to provide more accurate answers based on your environment it is required to do a much more deep analysis on your architecture, but that is more a consultancy case than support and we, Support Services, are not entitled to provide consultancy. If you think this is required please contact our Professional Services to address entirely the subject.

- Is it possible to be available with us through webex during the update?

R/ No, upgrade process and validation are out of our scope, such service can be requested to Professional Services, but in general term the upgrade process within the same version (5.0.4 in this case) doesn't require anything special so they are done by customers by themselves.


- Provide the documentation.

R/ As mentioned at the beginning of this reply, all is outlined in SOLIDserver Administrator Guide; there is no additional notes on this subject.


Having all these I look forward to your confirmation to close this case.

Best regards,
Ivan

28230,120344,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hi Lamees,

Thanks for your quick reply. I though you already have done some upgrades on your platform, but it is OK we will give you all assistance on the subject.

The guide can be retrieved directly from SOLIDserver GUI using Help option on ""?"" (help menu), which is available in all pages. As a visual hint, I have attached image ""SOLIDserver, guide document.jpp"" to this ticket.

Regarding the upgrade files, they are available in Efficient iP Support Site (http://www.efficientip.com/support-services/) under ""Product and Documentation Downloads"" section. From there navigate to SOLIDserver folder and use the relevant folder according to your branch (5.0.4).

It is no needed to install all intermediary patches, they are not cumulative. So you may upgrade directly from version 5.0.4.P2d to latest (5.0.4.P2k). If there are any particular hotfix different from HF-28230, that is already contained in regular patches, they should be manually applied again after the upgrade.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for contacting Efficient iP Support Team.

This ticket has been created because you are having problems resolving site ""eapp.takaud.com"".

In order to have clear all the information regarding that site, is that a site hosted in your infrastructure?

Is the resolution working fine in general for other domains?

I have checked that site and it seems it is an external site (not related to your domains), and even when I get the A record that is the only relevant for accessing a website, the website itself is not reachable. So in my opinion is an external problem in their (Takaud) infrastructure.

I look forward to receiving these details to define next actions.

28544,117177,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hi,

Thanks for this return and these details.

Considering ""takaud.com"" is an external resource, there is a high chance that something external to you is causing the difference responses you are receiving. And specially, since all other domains are responding fine and you don't have an especial setup for that particular domain (takaud.com), this is not a problem related to SOLIDserver. So we can only provide some limited responses, because we only offer support to issues and configuration of our product, not about what is external to it.

Nevertheless, the way you are doing the test is not the most effective for the problem you are trying to analyze. Using nslookup and setting type to ANY is not best practice in this case. 
- If you want to test what your clients are receiving: use nslookup and set type=A, that is the basic query. Setting type to ANY produce a different request that doesn't help in this case.
- If you want to test the behavior of your servers (cache or slaves): you must login into the server (ssh session) and use dig.

The second is what you should do in this case.

For example, in this case to test cache1 for this domain:
1- Using an SSH session, open a terminal (Tools > Start a shell)
2- Since you already have the IPs of the authoritatives of the zone ""takaud.com"", we use one of them: ns1.takaud.com [77.69.193.78], and do some tests:
# dig @77.69.193.78 www.takaud.com A
# dig @77.69.193.78 eapp.takaud.com A

On this way you can have the details that are suitable to understand the situation. These will have to be done also from the other servers to have the whole picture.
You may post here the results, to give you some hints about it. Nevertheless, please bear in mind that we have limited answers for this because it could be out of the scope of our products.

There are two cases that are typical and are out of our scope: network issues and administrative policies. For example if there is a problem of communication between your cache servers and Takaud, we will not be able to do anything about it. The second, if the administrators of Takaud have decided to block or limit the responses to your servers, it is an administrative situation that will require you to contact them to find out the reasons and look for a solution. These might be happening.

I look forward to receive the result of the tests from the servers to define next steps.

Ivan

-----------
Creating an Instant Backup
You can create an instant backup of the whole system configuration on demand. An image of the system will be generated and stored on the appliance. Each image can be then used to store the configuration of a SOLIDserver, which allows you to reload a previous backup in case of a revert back procedure.
Caution
Creating an instant backup during the enrollment of a Hot Standby appliance in High Availability may trigger an error.
To create an instant backup on demand
1. If you are not connected to SOLIDserver yet, log in. Only ipmadmin and members of the admin group can perform this operation.
2. Go to the Administration tab. If the homepage is not displayed, click on home button. The homepage opens.

Dear Naser, Lameesh

I am contacting you regarding your ticket 28955; My colleagues proposed some points applicable from Efficient IP appliance point of view, but I think you steps should start differently.

First,
Example of firewall capture just show small packet (DNS request) going to DNS server 193.188.97.210 and bigger reply going back.
Fully expected and my understanding is that firewall can see request/response.

So I do not understand statement that DNS may not reply back.
Can you take this back to your network team as this assumption does not look proper.

2nd, I think tcpdump will generate a log of data and will not be easy to read and check, therefore I propose:

You mobile team has to explicitly clarify source IP address of device having trouble with Instagram (or any test device); I want to identify what is source IP address of DNS request seen by DNS server
Do they have on initial device trouble with any other application? Can they browser properly web-pages - point here is to confirm if source IP address is properly added to allow-query, allow-query-cache on recursive DNS server as you have explicit list of defined network there. It is responsibility of BATELCO to add/delete as needed in case of new network implementation.

In case all other application - browsing different pages e.g. www.efficientip.com, facebook etc. works, I am confident that issue on recursive DNS servers.

In current case, there are fixed 8 problems that can cause a crash on the system; so potentially they can completely stop the service. For all details you may consult the relevant section of our website (http://www.efficientip.com/support-services/ > Release Notes & Changelog > SOLIDserver 5.0.4).

Our security team run a report for our servers and found that DNS server cache snooping remote information disclosure.

They recommend below steps to mitigate DNS cache snooping vulnerability.
- DNS cache should only be allowed access by local users or child caches
- Non-authoritative requests to DNS caches should not be allowed.
- Some entropy can be added by DNS caches or even DNS servers when giving out the initial TTL for a given record.

Please let us know your opinion and advice on above and let us know what can we do in this case ( EIP suggestion).

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP support. 
You have opened this ticket re request information regarding, preventing DNS snooping. 

This is actually a configuration choice - 

Options are to - 

1.  Leave recursion enabled if the DNS Server resides on a corporate network that cannot be reached by un-trusted clients
2. not allow public access to DNS Servers performing recursion
3. Disable recursion

But before changing anything It would be best if you can attach the part of the report you received regarding the vulnerability and

Version 6 is the latest major release of the SOLID server. 

IT has some major changes which has improved the performance drastically.

 The GUI is completely remodeled. The module-based distribution and navigation logic remain the, all the pages and wizards have evolved.

you can find more details and features upgrades from our knowledge base but most importantly, you have to note that it is currently not possible to do a straight forward upgrade from version 5 to 6, you will have to acquire EIP professional services and for that you can get in touch with the account manager.

At present, it is not necessary to update to version 6. As I've mentioned earlier the upgrade image for version 6.0.0 is expected in version 6.0.0.P2 to be released in Q4 2016.

The version 6 is a new major release of SOLID server and there are new features and enhancements. So the migrate from 5.0.4 to 6.0.0 is done only through our Professional Services.

If you are interested, please contact your sales representative to purchase professional services.

Sorry for this delay, I was trying to clarify the question; but I'm not sure to fully understand what you are really needing to know.

SOLIDserver is a product that can be used either as a physical appliance (I think this is what you call ""our servers"") or as virtual appliance. In this last case, it can be hosted on VMware infrastructure as any other VM (using for example ESX platform). In this sense also Hyper-V is supported. 

For all details on this subject you may consult our documentation ""SOLIDserver Configuration on Virtual Appliances"" and contact our Sales Team which has all details about possible implementation cases.

On the other hand, if the question is related to the features of SOLIDserver that allows provisions VMware VM with IP addresses from IPAM, I suggest to consult the guide ""Configuring SOLIDserver Plug-In for VMware vRO"" also available the documentation.

Please do not hesitate to confirm if this answers your question for closing this ticket.

Thank you for contacting the support services of Efficient IP.

This ticket is to request information about the upgrade process from version 5.0.4.P4 to 6.0.0.P2.

Within this new release the upgrade process has been validated and that is why there is an image file that allows this operation. In general all recommendations and steps are the same than any upgrade and they are outlined in our documentation (see Ch.82 ""Upgrading"" of Administrator Guide and the complementary upgrade documents).

As with any other upgrade, we (support service) cannot estimate the possible down time for your implementation because we don't have the elements for such analysis. Also as always, the process should be thoroughly validated by client in lab. None of these are within our scope as Support Service. In case you consider some special analysis or assistance is required, our Professional Service may assist by contacting the relevant commercial channel.

You have to run the command in the privillaged mode, 

log in via ssh 
then -->  su

/usr/local/etc/rc.d/snmpd status

If the service is running, please run the snmpwalk comman again from the management appliance, this time with the correct community.

snmpwalk -v 2c -c public 192.168.1.76 .1.3.6.1.4.1.2440.1.4.2.3.1.3   -------> you have to change  ""public"" with your community string. 

Unfortunately I am not able to have a remote session currently, but if you are available, we can have a remote session on Monday 30th.

During the remote session, we observed that the snmp profile for stats were configured for only 1.76 server. Without changing the settings back, we tool advantage of the version 6 and configured the DNS stats to work with the current default community string. 

First we defined the snmp profile, 

Administration --> System -> SNMP Profile configuration -> Add new profile with the community string. 

Secondly configure the DNS servers to use it for stats collection. 

Select the dns server --> Edit --> Configure SNMP monitoring parameters -> select the SNMP profile we created. 

After the changes we observed that the stats are working properly.Therefor we are closing the ticket as agreed.

And our concern is :
Keep in mind that if any error occurs during the upgrade you cannot rollback to a version prior to 6.0.0.P2. In this case, you must reinstall SOLIDserver in a prior version and restore the relevant backup file. 

Is it will risk on our DNS servers? How long will be the outage? What do you recommend?

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP support Team regarding the new security patches release 6.0.0.P3b and 6.0.0.P4. 
 
Since your current version is 6.0.0.P3a you can upgrade to the latest version 6.0.0.P4 directly. 

We highly recommend to apply the upgrade on a test environment first before upgrading SOLIDserver production appliances.

Upgrade process can take a while depending on the number of the appliances and the size of the database, during the upgrade a backup for the database will be generated automatically followed by reboots, upgrading the appliance version and database schema and it will end with restarts.

- Downgrading SOLIDserver from V6.0.0.P4 to V6.0.0.P3a is possible, the relevant backup file could be restored after the downgrade in this case.

- The backup file contain a backup for SOLIDserver data and configuration, SOLIDserver automatically generate new backup file before each upgrade, also the process can either be scheduled or triggered on demand, backup files are stored in the appliance itself and they are all listed in the Local Backup File.  

- There is no impact if you decide to not upgrade, but we always recommend the upgrade to take advantage of many enhancements in the new releases.

- SOLIDserver developing process never stop, new patches will be released every one to three months.

For detailed information about the backup and restore please open SOLIDserver Administrator Guide by clicking on the help button in the GUI and go to ""Managing Backups and Restoring Configurations "" section page# (978).

Thank you for contacting Efficient iP Support team.

At any time you have the possibility to display all the DNS queries of an EfficientIP or a BIND DNS server for this you have to enable the querylog command. In case if DNS querylog is not enabled before, it is too late to see the previous DNS queries.

Once you have enabled the DNS querylog on BIND level will record queries to /var/log/named.log. No need to create any specific file.

To execute the DNS querylog command please refer to our administration guide 6.0.0 “Monitoring DNS Queries and Answers”

Enabling querylog will speed up the log rotation, it would be interesting to export the logs to an external syslog server otherwise the hard disk will be full (Goto Administration tab > Monitoring > configuration of network logs).

Hi Brent, 
I'm going to add Stephane on the email, he will be able to get someone to reset your password for this tomorrow. We want to have a record of working with you on this issue, but I am still moving forward with this issue.  The review of the TSR show that the storage BP1 Power cable is not connected or is improperly connected.  I am not sure how comfortable you are with opening up the system and looking for a loose cable. Probably jiggled loose during shipment.  We can schedule to have a Field engineer go on site if you rather proceed this way.  If you feel comfortable with checking for a loose cable I have sent a diagram of the backplane.  Also I noticed this is referenced as ""Singapore Appliance Issue"" is the appliance in the United States or overseas?  We need to know so we have the Service Tags in the correct country.

Let me know how you want to proceed.

Best regards,
Jack

Thank you for getting back to me with creating the ticket.  In future ticket when you are working directly with Support you will want to specifically update the notes in IssueTracker because this alerts support you are needing feedback.  In this case, since you are not yet completely in production and we have PS still working with you, we can also email Brett, Steve, and Leah the status. 

As of now, I think we are still waiting on personnel from Singapore to check for loose cables. Please update us on your finding.

37987,173027,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hello Lamees,

Thanks for contacting Efficient IP support team

You report that you cannot resolve the names appleid.apple.com on the internet.

Could you please provide the result of the command dig? Have you tried a different browser and/or cleared cache and cookies of the one you are using? Let me know the result ?

# dig @ <server_ip> appleid.apple.com 

Please provide also a troubleshooting dump of the appliance that attempts the resolution (Administration> Tools> Troubleshooting dump)?

It would be interesting to do a network capture while you have the problem on your DNS server.

If not from the command line
# sudo tcpdump -w dnscapture.pcap -i [interface] host [adresse IPv4] and port 53

You will then type the following command to copy the file to /data1/exports:
dnscapture.pcap /data1/exports

The same file can be downloadable from  Administration> Maintenance> Local file listing.

In meantime I have reduce the priority of this ticket to P3

There is actually an internal case opened to allow to have the two required keys for the root (""."") trust anchor. This will be pushed with the next patch.

Thanks for having contacted the support service of Efficient IP.

This is to submit a security event reported by your security team related to suspicious connections originated from DNS appliance.

From details shared on attached document, it is noticed that activity has been correlated by your system with Morto Worm (W32/Pift). This thread targets Microsoft platforms exclusively, so it is discarded possible presence in SOLIDserver appliances, which are based on FreeBSD. [ref: https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2012-071013-3812-99]

Trying to understand what has been reported, probably it is based on the DNS records used by this type of thread [ref: https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/morto-worm-sets-dns-record]. That doesn't mean that DNS servers are infected, but as side effect some TXT RR has been inserted. If so, what should be traced are the DNS clients that did registrations  because they were compromised by thread. From DNS point of view, this are normal records, but they reveal the presence on the thread on your network / clients.

I hope this helps you to investigate further.

Since this is not a direct DNS problem I look forward to your confirmation for closing this report.

40354,189518,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hi,

Thank you for reaching EfficientIP Technical Support Team.

The recent disclosure of the Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) and Spectre (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715) vulnerability affecting modern processors triggers many questions regarding the related impact on EfficientIP products. These exploits technically permit any program to read the entire memory of a computer resulting in potential confidential information leak. However, these exploits require the execution of specially crafted payloads on the targeted host.

SOLIDserverTM security design does not permit non-administrator users to execute arbitrary code on SOLIDserverTM appliances. There is currently no identified vulnerability allowing remote code execution on the operating system for taking advantage of the Meltdown or Spectre exploits. As a result, the exposure is strictly limited to SOLIDserverTM administrators and there is no risk of DOS using these exploits directly.

However, in virtual environments, SOLIDserverTM shares the physical memory of the host with other virtual machines, so exposure is increased as a malicious payload can be executed on a third-party virtual machine to access physical host memory and so on SOLIDserverTM memory data. As a result: 

If you are running SOLIDserver on a public cloud provider, it’s very likely that they are currently deploying proper fixes on their infrastructure and SOLIDserverTM exposure is therefore limited. We highly encourage you to contact your cloud provider to estimate your exposure.

If you are running SOLIDserverTM in a private cloud environment, please refer to your hypervisor provider advisories to apply proper patches.

EfficientIP is currently working on a fix for its SOLIDserverTM products and will release a security patch as soon as possible. In order to mitigate this vulnerability, EfficientIP recommends you enforce
security best practices and limit access to critical infrastructure networking equipment to only trusted administrators from trusted administrative networks or hosts.

This is the first time I've noticed this ... there are IP's netchange is finding but is not doing the DNS resolution on the name.

I checked the DNS servers that are configured for the server and it resolves it just fine from my client.

May need to set the DNS resolver on the management.

Below are the steps to set:

Setting the DNS Resolver 

To configure DNS resolver (Add/Edit/Delete) 
Only users of the group admin can perform this operation. 

1. Go to the Administration tab. If the homepage is not displayed, click on homepage, click on network configuration

2. Click on the link DNS Resolvers. The wizard Edit DNS resolvers opens.

3. In the field DNS server IP address, type in the IP address of the server of your choice and click on add

4. The IP address is now moved to the list DNS Resolvers. 

5. Repeat these operations for as many resolvers as needed. If you have several resolvers.
 ?
* To update an entry, select a DNS resolver, change the needed data and click on update?
* To delete an entry, select a DNS resolver and click on  delete?

If you are still experiencing issues, please upload a recent backup and provide an example.

Thanks for joining the GTM session.

1) We identified that the HA had stopped replication
2) We re-initialized hat standby to add back to HA environemnt
3) Database replication was taking a long time
4) We tested network connectivity between the Master and the Hot-standby and identified that the bandwidth was only about .05MB/sec
5) We'll let the initialization continue to run
6) You'll follow up with network team to try and identify cause of network latency

42717,206566,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hi Lamees, 

Thank you for contacting EfficientIP Technical Support team. 
You have requested to add domain names in Arabic. 

Depending on client requirements, the system could be adapted for allowing/preventing different hostname conventions and this is global setting applicable under different practical wizards across different modules. More details about this can be gathered from Administrator Guide in section ""Changing the Hostname Convention"" (Ch.45 Managing DNS Resource Records).

Having those instructions in mind for this case the following two registry keys should be adapted for having the following regex:

www.display.checktype.regex.js.rfc1034 = (xn--)?(\*\.)?[_]?[-a-zA-Z0-9_]+((-+[-a-zA-Z0-9_]+)|(\.(xn--)?[_]?[-_a-zA-Z0-9]+))*
www.display.checktype.regex.js.rr_name = (^([*][.])?[_]?[-a-zA-Z0-9\u00c0-\uffff_]+((-+[-a-zA-Z0-9\u00c0-\uffff]+)|([.][_]?[-a-zA-Z0-9\u00c0-\uffff_]+))*$)|(^$)|(^[*]$)

To change this go to : Administration --> system --> Expert --> registry database and then filter www.display.checktype.regex.js.rfc1034 and www.display.checktype.regex.js.rr_name. 

From the DNS module, you will be able to create a record by typing directly with your Arabic keyboard. And from the IPAM module, use the Punycode notation to add a record.

Wanted to provide a summary of the GTM.

1) We identified that that  database replication had been disrupted since at least June 26th. 
2) We identified that the hot standby was not synced to NTP which likely caused the replication to fail.
3) We attempted to reset the hot standby and we modified the NTP server on hot standby
4) While monitoring the initialization the hot-standby failed again most likely due to us resetting the NTP server
5) You are re-adding back the hot standby again and will provide update and we can setup another GTM session if needed.
6) We reviewed upgrade best practice and procedures.

Thanks for joining the GTM session. 

1) We tried setting system module adjustments but could not account for the lack of bandwidth we tested. I've included a screen shot showing the bandwidth issues. Once you get the network team to check bandwidth we can then retry setting up the HA.

1) I opened a ticket with our network team to try switching the SIN appliance to another switch, or at least a different port (as an easy and quick thing to try).
2) The HA setup seems to have completed. 
3) After the HA seemed to be done (looking at log in the SSH session), the web console seemed to no longer work: the connection is timing out for both the ""local""/master and the remote/standby.

No, I have no questions. 

Replication keeps failing, the replication mechanism sucks, the protocol being used is unable to reliably keep the devices in sync, so we have no choice but to NOT do the setup that we said we wanted prior to buying these devices. I wasted too many hours trying to figure out what is wrong (and you've been very helpful in that regard), but since data CAN be transferred, there should be options/alternatives to the replication mechanism that would make this more reliable.

BTW, there are communications protocols around that have been available since the mid 1990's, like ZModem, that can reliably transfer data over long distances with poor connectivity, and also have the capability of resuming a connection. SOLIDserver offers no alternatives.

Replication has failed again. Restarting the sync process provides no insight into the transfer process. The GUI offers no information as to the status of the synchronization (meaning it doesn't show the status of the file transfer and it doesn't provide any helpful information around the replication issues so customers are left in the dark).

This is a very frustrating product with a development team that seems very disinterested in improvements or hearing complaints.

I realize this has been frustrating to you, we've worked extensively trying to modify registry setting and rules to accommodate for the lack of bandwidth we are experiencing. But as you can see from our test, 135 to 145kb per sec transfer speeds are not supported with the current database replication utilized. 

Have you been able to reach out to your network team and see if you can identify any issues that may be limiting the bandwidth, we already tested on the appliance side, ex removed lagg, tried only one interface, switched interfaces etc. 

At this point I'll do whatever you wish, escalate case if you like, but until we can get better communication between the hosts it'll be an ongoing issue.

Updates to the DNS module are not reflecting back into IPAM. We were told that this later upgrade (where we were formerly still on 6.0.1.P2a) would correct the issue.

While we have adjusted our documentation to reflect the fact this still is not working, it needs to be corrected at some point, as when we were being sold this product, one of the requirements we had which was clearly noted was that there needed to be bidirectional communication between modules, like other IPAM products.

Not sure who may have given you that information but I'm not aware of an upgrade that corrected replication to IPAM and DNS. I'd be happy to setup a GTM session tomorrow and we can check the current settings for replication and identify what needs to be done.

We have adjusted our documentation. 

I just wanted to raise this as an issue, because it seems like an issue that should have been raised in the pre-sales process. It is fairly significant and leads to an incomplete solution. The product is sold stating it has the ability to manage Microsoft DNS and DHCP, but if updates are not reflected back into IPAM, then this is not on par with other solutions such as Infoblox or Men & Mice or several others.

This is an issue that needs to be corrected.

Thanks for joining the GTM session and uploading the backup. I'll be coordinating with our PS services as well to make sure everyone is on the same page. Your current architecture does not have a DNS Smart. You were under the impression that no DNS Smart is required to perform the replication to IPAM and you only needed to upgrade to version 6.0.2.P2a to have the replication to IPAM.

I'll follow up on that point and PS will be able to discuss your specific design requirements based on the project roll out to determine what stage your at and where you need to be.

43856,215869,JABIL,"We have records of pre-sales meetings as well as post-sales and talks with other tech support folks where we were definitely told that changes via the DNS module (and DHCP) would reflect back into the IPAM module. That was one of the basic requirements for approval of a purchase. Later, when we discovered that these modules are not properly integrated, we were told that a pending update would be released that would correct this issue. (This is a pretty serious issue to have to deal with and should have been discovered long before our company came along.)

Now, without proper bi-directional communication between modules, it is possible to create a record from a Microsoft DNS MMC which would update into the SOLIDserver DNS module but would NOT reflect back into IPAM. In that use case, someone could then go into IPAM and find the address available and create a new address and DNS record, where the DNS record would duplicate an existing DNS record (now it would be like round-robin, except wrong). 

This will lead to potentially confusing situations. Telling us that the work-around is to have everyone use SOLIDserver is not adequate and doesn't address the issue where the modules are not properly updating bidirectionally. This is a very basic requirement!!

We cannot use SMART for DNS, if that is the answer that is going to be proposed, and we *specifically* asked about the way updates work before we bought this product, and we were assured that updates would be bidirectional, so that if changes originated in the Microsoft DNS MMC, they would be properly reflected in the SOLIDserver DNS module as well as the IPAM module.

The same applies to DHCP. Considering SOLIDserver still seems to not support the fail-over/load-balancing DHCP model with Microsoft DHCP, which has been available for years, the bidirectional updates need to be addressed ASAP and with priority.",public,rob_ingenthron@jabil.com

I discussed with Laurent yesterday just to be sure and confirm everything about DNS -> IPAM replication when SMART is not used. The situation described here should work fine in 6.0.2.P2x, it's true we had an issue but it has been fixed in this case (just for reference, its written in french):

https://support.efficientip.com/issuetracker/view.php?id=41935

So based on that, the replication DNS (MVSM without SMART) -> IPAM should work in 6.0.2.P2x.

For item 2:

I updated the lab IPAM OS to 6.0.2.P2b and tested this ‘bug’.  Manually adding DNS entries does indeed update in the DNS and IPAM tabs (non-SMART).  I also, tested this in production with the P2a revision and it also updated in IPAM (screen shot attached).  This, to me, is great news; however, there are still some nuisances to be aware of:

1.	Deleting records manually, does NOT remove the entry from the IPAM tab.
2.	In a SMART DNS config, the manual entries will NOT replicate to the IPAM tab.


As mentioned previously, before be bought this product, we were assured that updates from DNS (and DHCP) would reflect back into IPAM, regardless of SMART being used.  We expect that changes made in DNS will be reflected in IPAM regardless of the ""source"" of the change. If changes to DNS can be made that do NOT reflect in IPAM, then this is a bug and a serious logic flaw with this product that must be addressed.

Thank you for contacting EfficientIP support.

From the initial explanation of the issue, this is changing of the existing architecture. That means you need to contact the relevant department for consultations. However, I will try to answer the questions from a general point of view.   

1. In order to check the server with least traffic, From management appliance you can got to DNS--> Properties of each server in the SMART. There, you can see the server traffic graphs. 

2. Server access can be restricted via the firewall (Administration --> Network --> Firewall)

3. From the DNS point of view, from the properties of the SMART:

You have to restrict access to the BIND via the ACLs. For example: identify the client networks that will have access """"Allow-query"" , ""Allow-query-cache"", ""Allow-transfer"".  Further, you have to define the ACL values (client subnets) that are allowed to issue recursive queries --> ""Allow recursion""

44123,216815,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"FYI ..
ICANN Publishes Comprehensive Guide on What to Expect During the Root KSK Rollover 
22 August 2018
LOS ANGELES – 22 August 2018 – As the ICANN Organization prepares, for the first time ever, to change the cryptographic keys that help protect the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS), the organization has published a guide to let people know what to expect.
The changing of the keys, known as the ""Root Key Signing Key (KSK) Rollover"", is currently scheduled for 11 October 2018. The new ICANN guide is intended for those with all levels of technical expertise. It will help everyone prepare for the rollover by detailing what to expect. It is part of the ICANN Organization's ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the rollover and will also afford details about the rollover process.
The guide can be accessed here [PDF, 107 KB]. Those who will find the guide most useful are operators of validating resolvers seeking clear direction on what to look for once the rollover occurs; non-technical journalists, bloggers and others who intend to write about the rollover before, during, and after the event will also benefit. Additionally, the document can be of value researchers who will be monitoring the DNS for indications of resolver failure after the rollover occurs.
While ICANN org expects user impact from the root KSK rollover to be minimal, a small percentage of Internet users are expected to see problems in resolving domain names, which in lay terms means they will have problems reaching their online destination. There are currently a small number of Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validating recursive resolvers that are misconfigured, and some of the users relying upon these resolvers may experience problems. This document describes which users are most likely to see problems, and among those - what types of issues they will face at various times. To summarize:
Those who will not be affected:
•	Users who rely on a resolver that has the new KSK 
•	Users who rely on a resolver that does not perform DNSSEC validation 
Those who will be affected and how:
•	If all of a users' resolvers do not have the new KSK in their trust anchor configuration, the user will start seeing name resolution failures (typically ""server failure"" or SERVFAIL errors) at some point within 48 hours of the rollover. NOTE: It is impossible to predict when the operators of affected resolvers will notice that validation is failing for them. 
Data analysis suggests that more than 99% of users whose resolvers are validating will be unaffected by the KSK rollover. Users who use at least one resolver that is ready for the rollover will see no change in their use of the DNS or the Internet in general after the rollover. (The same is true for users whose resolvers do not perform DNSSEC validation at all. Current estimates are that about two-thirds of users are behind resolvers that do not yet perform DNSSEC validation.)
Lastly, while the rollover is currently planned to take place on 11 October 2018, this date is pending ratification by the ICANN Board.

As you did not join the goto-metting, I am now closing the session and reducing the priority of the ticket to P2.

To help you could check using a tcpdump on the DNS that your ping is received or not.

And you could also use ""tracert IP"" from your windows or ""traceroute IP"" from the DNS.

This will help you to figure from where the issues is coming.

Dear Lameesh,

We did check and NS4 is currently properly responding for public DNS queries on IP address  193.188.97.209.
From DNS point of view - NS4 responds properly

ping test is not appropriate check and may be block due other reason as well on your network part.
I can ping it remotely from Internet

sunnyday@mail:~$ ping 193.188.97.209

64 bytes from 193.188.97.209: icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=145 ms


My DNS test below loos OK (below)
Do you confirm same observation on your side?
As there is no immediately service interruption, I propose to lower priority to P2 and follow with support team during working hours.

Let me know if that's acceptable on your side.

We do want to explore the security state of a DNS placed outside of a protection device (firewall, IPS), for the length of this POC. Flaws in the implementation of the DNS protocol allow it to be exploited and used for malicious activities. Because DNS is such a critical protocol for Internet operations, best practices urge to harden DNS servers to prevent them from being used maliciously. To serve the purpose, please verify and implement the below hardening best practices and controls for DNS, with vendor overview.

44299,218214,JABIL,"Hello Brent,

Thank you for joining the GTM session, during the meeting we did a check on the current Master (Host Standby before the switch) and we noticed the GUI was not responsive, restarting the IPAM didn't work, so we cleared the browser history and that resolved the issue.

As we discussed during the GTM, in order to move the current Hot Standby (The old Master) to another location, we recommend to disable the HA configuration by deleting the server from the remote list, then turn it off and when the appliance is up and running with different network configuration, just add the appliance again and reconfigure the HA.

More information is available in (SOLIDserver administrator guide/High Availability Management/In the Event of a Network Disruption).

 
According to the confirmation during the GTM I will close the ticket,  please feel free to contact me or to open new ticket if you have any questions or concerns.


We invite you to participate in a short survey to provide feedback regarding the support you received in this ticket:

Well that's good news, I can't say I've seen that before, typically it's a firewall rule or maybe a network disruption. Keep an eye on it and let me know if you have any additional issues. I'll keep ticket open and check back next week.

...  module.dhcp.refresh_server_time refreshes leases every 10
seconds, when there are a lot of leases it can overload the service and create a loop.To avoid
this problem, you need to increase the value of the registry entry",public,chris_ingle@jabil.com

Sounds good. As for adjust the timing on the ""module.dhcp.refresh_server_time""

",public,chris_ingle@jabil.com
45663,227807,JABIL,"Hi Chris,

Since the version 6.0.0, we introduced Dynamic reservations is the new way of managing DHCP reservations with IP address the DNS records are only created if the DHCP lease is available (live).

Here is an example:

-When you reserve an IP in the IPAM module it will create a DHCP static and it not replicated to the DNS. Once the matching IP is assigned and active then only the DNS records will create 

-If the assigned IP is no longer active after a while the corresponding DNS entry will be removed.

Since you are not using the DHCP for certain clients you can create persistent DNS entries via IPAM out of DHCP scopes. There is one workaround which we can use to keep the DNS RR persistent or in-a-way bypass the dynamic reservation.

we can create a class parameter with ""persistent_dns_rr"" where the DNS RR will be persistent even if the dhcp client is not online and will be protected from being overwritten by a lease. 

To create the class parameter, go to space --> network(block) --> network(subnet) --> All addresses 

1. Settings --> Meta-data
2. click ""INPUT"" 
     a) Name : persistent_dns_rr
     b) Label: Persistent DNS
     c) Default value: 0 
3. Edit a DHCP static IP --> set ""Use IPAM name instead of DHCP client name"" 
             --> Persistent DNS: 1

45663,233225,JABIL,Okay.  I've updated one network per RB's suggestion and I'm still seeing inconsistencies with A records not correlating to PTR records.  I'm going to see if I can find some examples of this happening outside of the overlay.,public,chris_ingle@jabil.com
45663,233233,JABIL,"Hi Chris,

Just to recap and make sure we are still addressing the original issue. I wanted to review our last GTM session notes below:

""We were able to review the process that SOLIDSERVER utilizes to create the PTR records and initiated a successful test. Although you indicated that this process may not be suitable for your deployment as too many PTR records are created. IE: ""each subnet.""

""We are going to check if it would be possible to have PTR created without the IPAM option 'Create reverse zone'.""

This is the process that Remi was having you try: Related to a proposed work around to the normal process flow of creating the PTR records by checking box create reverse zone in IPAM.

Remi's proposed work around solution below:

One possibility :

1. In IPAM > Jabil > Settings > Wizard customization
 - tick ""Create a DNS reverse zone""
 - tick ""Select the DNS server where the reverse zone of a network will be created""
2. In IPAM, set the ""DNS server for reverse zones"" on the subnet the customer wants
3. In IPAM, rollback step 1 => untick ""Create a DNS reverse zone""
4. In DHCP, set Update DNS to 1
5. Test if a DHCP lease creates the RR (A and PTR)

So you are informing us that the solution Remi was having you attempt was not successful correct? 

We also discussed how to utilize SOLIDSERVER as only a reporting tool, in that case you could create a read only account in the MS DNS and DHCP environments. Is this still an option you are looking at utilizing? 

I want to be sure we are not mixing issues and are addressing the original concerns, if you have experienced any additional issues, or different behaviors let's keep them separate and address them independently.

45663,233235,JABIL,"Yes - based on my test in one production network, the wizard customization doesn't appear to work 100%.  Also, the adjusting the account to read only caused other warnings like ""delayed create, delayed delete, etc"".  

Maybe we can schedule some of Remi's time Monday or Tuesday morning to discuss further. Meanwhile, I'm looking for examples to see if this is happening outside of IPAM.",public,chris_ingle@jabil.com
45663,233236,JABIL,"Ok Chris, 

I'll follow up with Remi, to see when he will be available. As far as adjusting the account to read only caused other warnings like ""delayed create, delayed delete, etc"" That is expected, you cannot have the automation of the creation of records turned on if your using a read only account to utilize IPAM as a single pain of glass. 

We can review the available configuration options again on our next GTM session. We'll plan for next week.

In this one subnet (10.19.24.x):
we have six records that have a DHCP entry and an “A” record without a PTR record.
One record in DCHP without an “A” or PTR record (eGauge45589.corp.JABIL.ORG)

Thanks for joining the GTM session.

You informed us you had successfully added the DNS servers to the subnets that were missing the PTR records and that you were happy with the results. You still had additional question regarding the DHCP static replication process. We discussed how to setup the replication between IPAM and DHCP and that it can flow either way.

You'll continue to test in your lab and we'll keep ticket open in case you have any additional questions.

Subject: [Supreme Committee - Mannai] Session minutes (19/12/2018), final adjustments - part 2
To: Rishi Katakia <Rishi.Katakia@mannai.com.qa>
Cc: Jean HUBER <jean.huber@efficientip.com>, Jaikrishnan Vijayan <Jaikrishnan.Vijayan@mannai.com.qa>, Peter VANEK <pv@efficientip.com>


Hi All,

I'm replying on last mail for sharing today's session minutes because last mail from Rishi is on the same subject.

Here the summary of session:

Today we:
1- discussed triggers' results of last week for implementing final adjustments.
2- was explained how to change trigger from LOG to QUARANTINE mode, and how to revert.
3- was presented a DNS situation detected by Mannai/SC

Based on this:
- four triggers [4] (from the total 7) that were already validated have been to QUARANTINE mode.
- one trigger [1] (from the total 7) was validated for EiP but final decision of Mannai/SC was to keep it in LOG mode because one matched client is a DHCP server so moving to QUARANTINE could impact service. Is on Mannai/SC scope to decide when it could be passed to QUARANTINE mode based on their investigation/analysis.
- two triggers [2] (from the total 7) were still having too many hits so EiP did not validate this for being passed to QUARANTINE. EiP did adjustments and results should be verified for final validation.

I proposed to do new analysis of the two triggers still not finally validated after my return from holidays. But this could be done with support. Nothing special is needed from PS, no changes on architecture are required: only log analysis and recommend trigger modification.

Re last point (3), I explained this should not be related to SOLIDserver because we are not hosting zones. So delays in RR propagation should be an external event, unless a negative response is on cache. <b>This is on the scope of support service</b>. 

In all cases we will assist internally the Support Service as usually.

Best regards,
Ivan

There is no replication on this environment; I guess Jai is not using the proper terms for describing situation (this is just a note for avoiding confusion). The SOLIDservers (2x Guardian) are only doing forward to local internal domains.

I think we should see what are the exact tests they are doing and from what servers. A GTM could clarify situation quickly.

I  need to import the bulk records. I am attaching the sample of the exported record types that I need to import for more than 300 domains. Please let me know the format and way to do it. Can you show me with an example csv sheet.

This is needed as we need to migrate more than 300 domains to another Mail server. It is difficult to update / add record individually. Please help.

Please note that it is not possible to update the ticket every time by logging into the system , the reason being it would be a weekend on that particular day and no access to laptop. It would be preferred if the update over the email is considered. Having said that I am uploading the file that contains the records that I need to import in the bulk into the DNS. Please let me know how this can be done and the format. I have migration tomorrow morning so this is urgent please.

During the remote session, we have noticed all your Solid servers are working fine. Therefore it is not a critical issue to raise this ticket as P1. 

The issue was only one public domain “owa.fifa.org” not reachable through browser Firefox.  Maybe due to some proxy issue. On the other browsers like IE & Chrome, the URL is reachable. With your agreement, I am closing this case.

Your opinion is very important for us to continue to improve our service, we would really appreciate if you can fill this below survey

Thanks for contacting EfficientIP regarding Enhancement request: ""We would like to request a read only mode"". Can you be a little more specific, do you want IPAM just reading the MS-DHCP but not able to update the MS-DHCP.

46877,236884,JABIL,"Hi Chris, 
Thanks for joining the gtm today. During this quick gtm, regarding your lab environment. The Agentless dhcp server was removed and added back into the IPAM management appliance. After adding the server back, the leases show within the dhcp server on management appliance, but not all of the active leases are showing in IPAM. Did a few tests of ipam replication and initialization rules. The advanced properties are set to update IPAM. Also updated one of the scopes from the agentless server with no change.  Since this is a lab, we also restarted ipmserver.sh, no change.  Chris is providing backups before the change and after to evaluate.  

Best regards,
Jack",public,jack.willis@efficientip.com
46877,236914,JABIL,"Hi, Chris, can you perform a test with a lab client.
If I understand the issue correctly when you added the dhcp agentless server back into IPAM management, the active leases where there and also showed up in IPAM. But some did not show up or were deleted from IPAM, still showing in dhcp All leases. 
If for instance, you had the client release the lease and force to renew the lease. Does the lease then show up in IPAM?


<b>Clients always update IPAM:</b> All the DHCP clients update the IPAM no matter their name, IP or MAC address. In other words, every client getting a lease has their information pushed to the IPAM (name, MAC address and IP address) even if their name has already been pushed to the IPAM. This is the most permissive mode. Keep in mind that only the latest lease information updates the DNS.

Best regards,
Jack

46877,236929,JABIL,"I released and renew'ed a client's IP and synced the DHCP server and scope.  Still shows the info in IPAM but not the lease data.  Also, 'clients always update ipam' has always been set.",public,chris_ingle@jabil.com
46877,236947,JABIL,"Hi Chris, 
I think you have the setting correct, but the issue is the dhcp is not going to update IPAM until the dhcp server knows to update IPAM all address.  What I think should be happening is you have the IPAM >All leases>10.200.203.103 deleted and shows as a free lease.  Without a pool, you only have one-way communication dhcp>ipam.   With IP address 10.200.203.103 deleted in ipam and you delete the active lease under the DHCP tab > All addresses.
This should cause communication with the agentless dhcp server and IPAM so it gets the information from the server and sends to IPAM to update.

If you want we can have another gtm and test. 

Best regards,
Jack",public,jack.willis@efficientip.com
46877,236948,JABIL,"Hi Chris,
Since this is in a lab, if you want we can try putting the agentless dhcp server in the smart. add the subnets to the smart then create the pools which will create the dhcp ranges on the server.  Then you should have bi-directional communication.

I'm not sure why you wouldn't want to have pools, they are optional though. If the configuration is working correctly now within the smart architecture it is up to you. Pools allow you to divided your IP addresses by subnet-type networks. In SOLIDserver Administration Guide: Chapter 17. Managing Pools provides more information on this.

46877,237362,JABIL,"Hi Chris, 
The SOLIDserver Administration Guide 6.0.2 can explain it better than I can.
Chapter 23. Deploying DHCP Smart Architectures; Section: <b>DHCP Servers Managing IPv4 Addressing:</b> explains that SOLIDserver smart architecture allows for the management of Microsoft DHCPv4 'Single Server'.  It also points out that Microsoft Windows DHCP services do not provide failover, so cannot be configured from the appliance.

Also to clarify, Version 7 that JABIL is planning to move to after release has the ability to allow FAILOVER.  The reason also for the smart is 'smart ios' is needed to send info from IPAM to DHCP.

From Chapter 23
• Single-Server: this configuration manages one DHCP server. It provides a backup of the configuration that is pushed onto a new DHCP server if ever the original server crashed or stopped
responding.

We strongly recommend that you manage every DHCP server with the smart architecture that
suits your needs. Indeed, one of the main goals of this virtual management tool is to backup of
your configuration.",public,chris_ingle@jabil.com
46877,237527,JABIL,"Hi Chris, 
The reason that IPAM starts populating after you add the Agentless dhcp server into the smart is that the 'smart ios' is needed to have a bidirectional transfer of information between from IPAM and DHCP.

Hello Gentlemen-

 

Just spoke with Customer regarding Ticket 46877– seems they had issues describing what they wanted to do – but eventually got it worked out.

 

Now they are asking for us to validate that we will officially support what we were able to make work in their lab.

 

Background 

Customer purchased EIP to manage existing Microsoft DNS & DHCP.  They did not tell us they had MS DHCP Failover.  So they have been waiting for that functionality– but they have projects that are on hold waiting for this capability. 

They know version 7 is coming but had issues with initial rollout and do not want to roll out new version in production so want to wait as long as they can AND get version 7 training in next few weeks.
In the Lab they said Remi assisted them with the following setup and want to validate if they call in support they will get assistance:

They have Server A & Server B in Microsoft DHCP failover.  They want to use MVSM to pull DHCP information from Server A so that they are able to see lease information in IPAM- they do not want to manage the DHCP service (edit scopes, ranges, options) or manage the failover – they just want to pull in lease information.

Please let me know if you have any questions for need further information.

46877,238053,JABIL,"Hello Chris,

As seen during the GTM, the issue was resolved by modifying an Advanced Properties at the DHCP server level : untick 'Use client name (FQDN)'.

We saw in the debug with the generic_rules enabled, that when we initialize the rule on the Active DHCP lease, the name was not taken into account and no replication was done on the IPAM.

After disabling this option, the replication is correctly done.

For information, when you used a Smart DHCP (after converting the DHCP server into a Smart), the issue was not occuring.

I will do some test on my side and try to reproduce this behavior.

The issue is resolved by a temporary solution which is adding a forward zone. But we notice this issue with other .com , .net ... etc domains.

From viva and Zain other operators,  domains get the update immediately but from Batelco we are facing delays and sometimes it take 5 days to update.

Hello Dmitry,

I'm Remi from the Support team and I'm currently handling case #46955. In this ticket, we are directly discussing with Lamees from Batelco, so I don't know why they are asking you about the progress of this ticket.

Anyway, this ticket concerns two purposes :
1. DNS server not correctly resolving names => resolved by adding customer IP in the allow-query statement

2. DNS server does not give correct answer (old A value), when some domain administrators did changes => normal DNS cache mechanism.

If they are still facing any issue or they think DNS servers are not correctly working, they can update the case.

Hello Sharat,

Thank you for your mail.

If we are speaking about the same thing which is ; DNS servers reply with old information, so there is no problem here. But I can understand that the customer thinks there is an issue.

In fact, we are speaking about DNS cache mechanism. As long as the old resource record value is in the cache, the DNS server will not ask the authoritative DNS server for an update. That's why, when manually flushing the cache, the 'issue' will be resolved, as it will force the DNS server to ask the authoritative server for the current RR value.
I want to be sure that this behavior is well understood by the customer.

If the DNS server keeps responding with old resource record value is because the domain administrator that did the change on his authoritative server did not follow the best practices (decreasing TTL value before the change).

To workaround this they can :
1. Manually flushing the cache
2. Set a maximum TTL value for the RR in the cache (this is maybe what Viva or Zain are doing).

To workaround this you can :
1. Manually flush the cache.
2. Set a maximum TTL value for the RR in the cache

Second option permits to set a maximum TTL for all the RR in the cache, even if the real TTL on the authoritative server is higher than the value you set.

For example, with a max TTL value of 3600 on your DNS server, even if the real TTL of the RR is 14400, the TTL in the cache will be 3600. The side effect of this modification will be more recursion done by your DNS server (as the RR in the cache expire more quickly than is should).

We found where the issue comes from and why we were unable to reproduce it at the beginning!

The customer has a specific security option enabled in his IE11.
By default, because of security purpose, this option is disabled.

You can check it here:
<i>
    Internet Options
    Security tab
    In ""Internet"" or ""Intranet"" click on Custom Level
    In the Security Settings scroll down until you see “Include local directory path when uploading files to a server” and disable it.
    Click OK on Internet Options window and refresh.

I will open a ticket on our side to fix the issue no matter the security option is disabled or not.",private,wm@efficientip.com

Thank you for your time, the issue was that you were not able to add any DNS RPZ Zone on your recursive dns smart architecure. The error message ""Unable to add the zone ""q8trader.com"": you cannot add ""RPZ"" zones on this type of architecture"" was returned when you try to add a DNS RPZ zone.

After checking, the reason was that the option "" Forced Hybrid DNS compatibility "" was ticked for this smart architecutre which prevent from adding any DNS RPZ zone because such type of zone is not supported by Hybrid DNS Engines.

This information is mentionned at the page 649 of the SOLIDserver Administration Guide at the section ""Hybrid DNS Engines Limitations"". Such option was unchecked and we were able to add the rpz zones q8trader.com and q8trader.broker .

You confirmed that after adding the RPZ zones the domain were not reachable anymore by querying them on the cache servers.

We highly recommend to do the upgrade in a Test environment first before upgrading any appliance in the production to validate the upgrade. 

To upgrade appliances in High Availability there are two ways:

1- Upgrade both appliances at once from the Master appliance 
2- Upgrade the appliances one after the other, starting with the Hot Standby appliance

Please check for more information (SOLIDserver Administrator Guide/Upgrading/Upgrading Appliances in High Availability)

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Best regards,
Tarek",public,tarek.alkattan@efficientip.com
48258,246078,JABIL,Hah - this is quite possibly the most worthless response I have ever received.,public,chris_ingle@jabil.com
48258,246101,JABIL,"Hi Chris,

Sorry if I missed your points, what I tried to explain:

1- Please don't test the upgrade on the production directly.
2- From what I see you chose (Upgrading One Appliance at a Time)
From the guide :

1. Make sure the appliances meet the High Availability prerequisites.
2. Download SOLIDserver image
3. Update the HA files database from the Master
4. Disable the automatic re-enrollment from the Master
5. Upgrade the appliances one after the other
6. Make sure both appliances are upgraded
7. Save the backup generated during the upgrade from both appliances
8.Enable the automatic re-enrollment from the Master

If you didn't follow the exact steps the upgrade may not be completed.

If you provide me with a backup so I can test the upgrade in our LAB that will be helpful too

Please let me know if you have any further question.

Best regards,

48258,246400,JABIL,"Hello Chris,

Thank you for joining the GTM, during the meeting we noticed that the VM version was 7 and thats what caused restoring the version 6 backup to fail, the solution in this case is:

1- a fresh installation for the exact same version of the production 
2- Restoring the production backup without (Restore the System configuration) option
3- Check and install all the customization that you have on the production.
4- Once you verify everything is ok, perform the upgrade steps.

If you decide to rollback to the previous version after the upgrade you can use the following command from the CLI after switching to root:

#/usr/local/nessy2/script/rollback_upgrade.sh

Or you can take a snapshot VM for the appliance before the upgrade so you can get back to it to repeat the test if needed.

As we discussed I will keep the ticket open and wait your feedback, please feel free to update the ticket if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Monitoring DNS Answers
At any time you have the possibility to display all the DNS answers of an EfficientIP or a BIND
DNS server from the CLI.

Answerlog is a toggle command that provides an overview of all the DNS answers in IPv4 and
IPv6. It uses the same information structure as querylog, each log contains: client information,
recursion details, DNS options when relevant... For more details, refer to the log structure in the
section Monitoring DNS Queries.
When answerlog is on, it displays two lines: first the initial query, second the answer received by
the client followed by the return code of the answer: NOERROR, SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN...
To toggle on the DNS answerlog command
1. Connect to your appliance via a shell session.
2. Use the following command:

/usr/local/nessy2/bin/rndc answerlog
The logs look as follows:
# Line 1: the initial client query.
# Line 2: the answer sent to the client followed by the return code of the answer.
Nov 18 18:05:08 my-appliance-hostname named[1552]: client 127.0.0.1#31070 (www.google.com): view
vue3: query: www.google.com IN A +E (127.0.0.1)
Nov 18 18:05:08 my-appliance-hostname named[1552]: client 127.0.0.1#31070 (www.google.com): view
vue3: answer: www.google.com IN A +E (127.0.0.1) -> NOERROR www.google.com. 95 A 74.125.71.99
A 74.125.71.103 A 74.125.71.104 A 74.125.71.105 A 74.125.71.106 A 74.125.71.147
To toggle off the DNS answerlog command
1. Connect to your appliance via a shell session.
2. Use the following command:
/usr/local/nessy2/bin/rndc answerlog

If you want the DNS answer to be loggued you have to follow the steps provided by TIm :

============
To toggle on the DNS answerlog command
1. Connect to your appliance via a shell session.
2. Use the following command:
/usr/local/nessy2/bin/rndc answerlog
============

Then you can check if the DNS answer logs are correctly sent to your remote Syslog server.

If you want to permanently have the query log and answer log enabled, you need to :

============
1. Connect in SSH on the DNS server and change to root :
% su

2. Edit the file /usr/local/nessy2/etc/named/options_include.conf and add the 2 lines below :
querylog yes;
answerlog yes;

3. Restart DNS service
# service ipmdns.sh restart
============

Just a quick summary of the session,

We restore your certificate on the primary server, but we figured that something went wrong with the database. 
To fix it we set the secondary as Master, then re-create the database of the primary, and re-enroll it.
After the replication as finished we set it back to master.

When the troobleshooting dump will be done, please upload it to the ticket and if it possible it will be helpfull to have the backup from yesterday 10PM and the one from this morning.

I am reducing the priority of the ticket as the service is now working again.

We try to execute REST API query as per documentation using ip_add method. It's described on page 156 of REST API document.

There are only 2 mandatory parameters and we specify them. However we are getting Bad Request reply from our IPAM. 

Could you help to check what is not working and why?",public,rodion_esartiia@jabil.com
48600,248710,JABIL,"Hello Rodion,

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP Support Team regarding an issue with REST API call.

While looking at this, we noticed that the ip_hostaddr at the top was defined in hex as 0a090402 but in decimal it is 10.9.8.2. The third octet of this ip address doesn't match (the hex would convert to 10.9.4.2). We wanted to verify that this is correct because if you try to use ip_add to update an address and the ip_id and ip_address don't match, you will get a 400 error. You actually don't need the hostaddr in this call if you have the ip_id. Also, if possible can we get the values of the variables being used. The ip_address_list call has a ""ip_subnet_id"" variable but the variables defined at the beginning of the script is ""subnet_id"" - are we using the correct variable names in the URL call?

Best regards,
Tarek",public,tarek.alkattan@efficientip.com
48600,248720,JABIL,"Dear Tarek

1) Hex to IP online converter shows 0a090402 as 10.9.4.2 so it seems to be correct.
2) I attached the screen from IPAM REST API result with IP object that shows this data so we didn't do anything (just took values from it).
3) Here is complete PS script that we use to reproduce. I made few changes to variable names to make it more human-readable and forgot to change it in this ticket:

a) we specify variables
$ip_subnet_id = '9431'
$ip_addr  ='0a090402'
$ip_hostaddr = '10.9.4.2'
$ServerName = 'testservernmae'

b) we get IP object to get IP_ID from it

     $ipObject = Invoke-RestMethod ""https://ipam/rest/ip_address_list/WHERE/subnet_id='$ip_subnet_id' and ip_addr='$ip_addr'"" -Headers $headers

        $site_name = $ipObject.site_name
        $ip_id = $ipObject.ip_id

in result we see that $site_name = Jabil and then $ip_id = 0. The bad thing that it shows ip_id = 0 and it's weird. We just upgrade our ipam to 7.0. Can it be because if it or something is not okay with query? 

c) we take this data from step b and use here. I removed ip_addr from this call. Thank you!

   Invoke-RestMethod ""https://ipam/rest/ip_add?ip_id=$ip_id&name=$ServerName&site_name=$site_name"" -Headers $headers

Invoke-RestMethod : The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.

It seems it's working fine. Last question. How can we encode space in this case (in case of rpc and in case of one of parameter's value has space.

E.g.
Invoke-RestMethod ""https://ipam/rpc/ip_add?hostaddr=$ip_hostaddr&name=$ComputerName&site_name=$site_name&ip_class_name=Server&ip_class_parameters=Application Owner=$ComputerName"" -Headers $headers

In this case there is a space required between 'Applicaiton' and 'Owner' 

We tried to space %20 but it didn't work

Invoke-RestMethod ""https://ipam/rpc/ip_add?hostaddr=$ip_hostaddr&name=$ComputerName&site_name=$site_name&ip_class_name=Server&ip_class_parameters=Application%20Owner=$ComputerName"" -Headers $headers",public,rodion_esartiia@jabil.com

If you looked at the custom field (Application Owner) that you created in Class studio, click on it and you will find two fields (Name, Label) , in the API you need to use what you see in that Name field not the label field.

The current <em>module.dhcp.refresh_server_time</em> has a value of 30 seconds. The amount of time to populate this information is based on the size of the appliance, the data and traversing the network. Please increase the value to 3 to 6 minutes and see if the busy status reduces.

When the module.dhcp.refresh_server_time is increased for example to 3 to 6  minutes when previously set to 30 seconds.  The server will be less busy.

When the servers have this value set to 30 seconds it will start the process, but say it takes 40 seconds to complete, it will immediately start refreshing the server as soon as it completes the refresh.
By having it set to 3 minutes as an example that can be adjusted until it works for you. And in the same example, the server is taking 1 minute to refresh, then the server will wait 2 minutes before it starts the refresh process and the server should be in the OK status for the 2 minutes.

Thanks for contacting Efficient IP support team

It is possible to block a block or redirect the request with the DNS firewall (RPZ). This information can be found in the administrator guide ""Chapter 42. DNS Firewall (RPZ)""

Please note that RPZ can block specific domains and subdomains, specific IP addresses but not specific URL. For this, you might need to use a proxy or a firewall.

We received Many customer complains can't Receive email and got the following errors. Please investigate and update.
 
The following message to <isee@batelco.com.bh> was undeliverable.
The reason for the problem:
5.1.2 - Bad destination host 'DNS Hard Error looking up batelco.com.bh (A):  domain has no A record'

example of customer emails 

sayedali.shubbar@batelco.com.bh
isee@batelco.com.bh
horse@batelco.com.bh
bascrd@batelco.com.bh

The email support (AWS) reply the following:
5.1.2 - Bad destination host 'DNS Hard Error looking up batelco.com.bh (A):  domain has no A record'""


Usually, this issue relates to the DNS records not having completely propagated. The A record mentioned in the error refers to the fallback mechanism the SMTP standard/RFC5321 uses when the sending email server cannot resolve MX records.

Further investigating your issue, I can see in the DNS Propagation Map tool [1] that your domain ""batelco.com.bh"" MX records are not being propagated to all regions. This means that if someone in one of these regions that cannot resolve the MX records for your domain tries to send an email, will result in the error you have shared. 

I have checked your Route 53, but it seems you do not have any hosted zones for ""batelco.com.bh"". With that being said, I advised you to contact your DNS provider that hosts your domain ""batelco.com.bh"" and investigate why it is not being propagated to all regions

Please advice.

The sshd logs can be found in '/var/log/auth.log' 
This also can be found in the Administration module 
-Menu Monitoring>Log Visualization  This opens up Syslog
- choose the Service 'auth' and you can filter on log & time as needed.

I'm not sure what they are referring to concerning the change command logs, can you please clarify.


As far as generating a read-only user, this would be covered in SOLIDserver Administrator Guide Part XII. Rights Management.  They would need to create a user assigned to a group that has the Resources and properties set to display the required resources.

   With respect to the OS read-only user, I consulted with CLARO what type of vulnerability scan they performed and they told me the following:

   ""Usually 2 types of scans are made on the platform

A. SCAN OF INFRASTRUCTURE VULNERABILITIES (Retinal Saneo)
B. SCAN OF VULNERABILITIES OF MANAGEMENT WEBSITES (Scaneo Acunetix)

Can you provide more information on these CLARO scans, are they created by Claro?  I don't think it is possible to generate a read-only user of both the OS (FreeBSD) and the administration interface GUI (IPAM).  
I think you would need to use the admin account.

I'm going to ask the escalation team, but if you can give clarification they may have already worked with getting these scans performed from CLARO.

   Good day, I was testing with sending logs to an external syslog, but I have a problem.

   What happens to me is strange: although he sent when I logged in with different users and when he created a block, he did it only the first time. I want to say that I went back to log in with different users and returned to generate other blocks and never again sent it to the syslog.

   Check the logs locally in the IPAM, and I see the same thing I send to the Syslog. Could it be that there is some issue of logs in the local IPAM that is incorrectly configured? (Please see files ""Log IPAM 05082019.txt"" & ""External Syslog 05082019.txt"").

    I already have the syslog server configured to send me the ipmserver, ipmserver-rules and auth logs (as you suggest above, please see the file ""Network Logs COnfiguration 06082019.JPG"").

   I feel like I stop writing in the local log, look at the dates of the logs, the last ones are 8/3 (see files ipmserver log 06082019.JPG and ipmserver-rules log 06082019.JPG). Is there any way to verify this, restart some service maybe?

49774,258555,Baxo Systems,"Hi Martin, 
Maybe you did not want the Forwarding Rule? Take a look at SOLIDserver Administrator Guide Chapter 76. Monitoring section <em>Forwarding Rule Operations to Syslog</em>
I think this is why you are not seeing the logs locally anymore, you can change this back and see if it starts working as expected.
 
<b>Forwarding Rule Operations to Syslog</b>
<pre>
To decrease memory usage in the database, you can store the logs triggered by rules in the external file ipmserver-rules.log, either on the appliance or a remote server.
When the related registry database entry is enabled, note that:
• Any new operation triggered by a rule is no longer available on the page User Tracking but Syslog.
• On the page User Tracking, the drop-down list Rule filter disappears.
• The page User tracking displays all the previous logs independently of their source, whether it was triggered by a rule or user action.
• If some bookmarks, alerts, top lists and/or charts were created based on these logs, they are automatically deleted.

49837,256051,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello,

All the Guardian triggers action are set to 'quarantine'. Quarantine is less permissive than block (clients in quarantine will only get answers from Guardian cache, if the information is not in the cache there will be no reply).

Changing from quarantine to block : clients that triggered a rule will not have answers at all during a period (period define in the rule).

Setting quarantine or block depends on your needs.

Its not clear , so you are confirming the configration are in place ?

Can you please let me know , the below configuration are also place ?

The attack like 

DNS tunneling 
DNS exfiltration
DNS Trojan activity 

How does Guardian detect all these attack , are we good in terms configuruation , please check and confirm",public,m.pallikandy@sc.qa
49837,256223,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello,

Currently you have seven triggers configured for different protection.

Trigger T5 can be used to protect against DNS tunneling and DNS data leak. Currently this trigger is set to logging. So if the trigger is match, there will be only a log but no block or quarantine.

If you want to check if the trigger T5 has been match you can :
1. Check the /var/log/named.log with 
# grep T5 /var/log/named.log

2. Verify the Guardian Statistics charts in the DNS servers properties page from the Management GUI.

If you want to change the status of the trigger from logging to quarantine :

==================
1. Connect on the DNS server and change to root:
% su

2. Connect to the Blast CLI
# /usr/local/nessy2/bin/blastcli

3. Modify the trigger T5 
DNS Blast>  update trigger 5 ""New T5 - Suspicious Behavior query_size_missed %0"" enabled quarantine@60 miss_query_size_not_exist@7 push_param cache_miss_not_exist@7 / 59 > cache_miss_not_exist@7 2 >= &
==================

Guardian detects these attacks depending on the triggers configured. The parameters which have been defined generally match suspicious clients behaviors.

Regarding DNS Trojan activity, what do you mean exactly ? What kind of activity ?

Thank you

Remi

49837,256311,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello ,

If I enabled the Quarantine mode will it create interruption ?

Yes, we have 7 trigger are configured , will cover all the recommended  necessary requirements   do you recommend more  to have full protection ?

DNS Trojan mean DNS malware 

What is this Gaurdian static page , you mean the Analytics page , can you please be specific ?",public,m.pallikandy@sc.qa
49837,256316,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello,

Changing the trigger T5 from none to quarantine will affect clients matching the trigger T5 for a period of 60 seconds.

So, when a client has a behavior that match trigger T5, his IP will be set in quarantine for 60 seconds, which means that this IP will get DNS replies only from Guardian DNS cache. If during these 60 seconds, the client IP need a DNS answer which is not in the cache then the query will be ignored. More details in the Administrator Guide page 704.

Details about Guardian statistics charts are available at pages 690-691.

For DNS malware, what do you mean exactly ? a malware that changes the DNS configuration on a client ? If this is the case, this kind of protection is done by anti-malware products.

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP technical support.

It is not mandatory to upgrade to version 7.1.0. It depends on your needs. You can have a look at the release notes : https://mirror2.efficientip.com/support/downloads/SOLIDserver/7.1/

It is also important to read the Important Notes : https://mirror2.efficientip.com/support/downloads/docs/7.1/SOLIDserver_Important_Notes-7.1.pdf

At least, you can upgrade to 6.0.2.P5b which contains two fixes :

In case SSL certification failed to install properly, GUI becomes unreachable due Apache service not reloading properly with new configuration.
It is necessary to re-install 'new default' certificate temporary to get access to GUI again

Connect via ssh to impacted SOLIDserver and become root with 'sudo su'

Create a backup directory:
# mkdir /data1/sslbackup
Move the current certificates:
# mv /data1/ssl/host.crt /data1/sslbackup/host.crt

49971,256764,JABIL,"Hi Brent,

Thanks for joining the GTM session. 

We identified that apache was not starting properly because it required a passphrase. We were able to manually start by typing in the passphrase. You'll follow up with your CRT team to see if you can re-create without passphrase.

Administrator's guide notes:

This certificate must respect the CRT format and must not contain any passphrase. If it does, the HTTP protocol cannot start and you might lose the GUI access to your appliance.


Kind regards,

Tim Gormley",public,tim.gormley@efficientip.com
49971,257127,JABIL,"Hi Brent,

I take it you were able to remove the passphrase, I'll go ahead and close ticket unless you need any additional information.

Yes, we are good here.

 we used openssl on the appliance. adding these steps after the cert install using the GUI:

1. How do I check we are getting update from Surbl
2 .How can I see the RBLs downloaded and the actual detections/blocks based upon them?
",public,m.pallikandy@sc.qa
50005,257033,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello,

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP technical support.

1. As Surbl feeds are retrieved by DNS zone transfer, you can check in the /var/log/named.log file of your DNS server that the RPZ zone transfer has been done successfully.

2. By default, you can't check in the GUI the content of the slave RPZ zone. SURBL feeds contains lots of resource records, and having them in the GUI will add lots of datas in the Management database.
You can check if a domain is in the SURBL list by going to : http://www.surbl.org/surbl-analysis

To check if a client match the RPZ, you can check in /var/log/named.log of your DNS server, filtering on RPZ.

Kind regards,
Remi",public,rb@efficientip.com
50005,257067,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hi,

I have checked the file didn't understood anything ..

Here the question is how do I comfim my DNS appliance has latest DB from SURBL , something like updated date ,so that I can make sure it has latest update.. for example for IPS and AV will have updated signature correct something like that",public,m.pallikandy@sc.qa
50005,257082,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello,

In the properties of the RPZ zone you can check the value of the serial number. Each time an entry is added into the zone, the serial number increase, so it can be a way to verify if the zone is up to date.

Kind regards,
Remi",public,rb@efficientip.com

I am very new to this box , so let me know where I can",public,m.pallikandy@sc.qa
50005,257091,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello,

In the DNS module > click on the Smart DNS > you will have all the zones listed > right click on the RPZ zone (the one for Surbl) > Properties. The Serial number will be shown in the Main Properties box.

50005,257120,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello,

Masters are the IPs of the Surbl DNS server providing the RPZ zone.
If the Serial number of the zone is not displayed here, you can try pretty the same but by accessing the properties of the zone directly on the DNS server and not the Smart DNS :

In the DNS module > click on the DNS server (below the Smart DNS) > you will have all the zones listed > right click on the RPZ zone (the one for Surbl) > Properties. Serial number should be listed.

50005,257156,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello,

Yes this is the page. I think the Serial Number (part of the SOA record of the zone) is not visible due to the fact that, by default, the Management does not retrieve the content of a RPZ slave zone.

The other way to check if the RPZ is up to date and correctly transfered to you DNS server is to go to Administration > Logs visualization
At the top of the page :
SOLIDserver : your DNS server
Service : named
In the log field, filter with : rpz.surbl.org

You will have the logs saying that rpz.surbl.org has been transferred successfully, which means the zone is up to date.

50005,257447,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello Manseer,

From your screenshot, slave zone for SURBL is correctly transfered.

   I am testing in a test environment the authentication of users by Active Directory and then pass it to production. In accordance with chapter 73 of the ""Managing Authentication Rules"" user manual, I generated a rule (please see files Rule 01.JPG, Rule 02.JPG, Rule 03.JPG and Rule 04.JPG).

On SOLIDserver Administration module
Is there a user created: ""user3""

50116,257757,Baxo Systems,"Hi Jack:

   But I do not understand, if I generate the user ""user3"" locally, is logging in with that local user? How do I know that I am logging in with the ""user3"" in the Active Directory?

Regards,

Martin Pedros",public,mp@baxosystems.com
50116,257759,Baxo Systems,"Hi, 
Did you add the ""user3"" to group ""solidserver""? 
Administration module>System>User,Groups & Rights
- click on Groups
- click on the group ""solidserver""  <em>this brings up resources page</em>
- Add>Users> tick ""user3"" and confirm/close
=======

You have the Synchronize value set to 'no' so the solidserver will be the reference for the group (the user's assignment is done manually to SOLIDserver groups.)

if the value was 'Yes'; Active Directory is the reference for the group; SOLIDserver will assign a user to each group matching AD group membership.

If above doesn't work we need to turn on debugging get the results and <b>Once Done</b>go back and change the value back to '0'

=====Turn on debugging if that doesn't work and provide results ==========
Can you turn debugging on and then log in with an AD ""user3"" account that is not getting access to capture in the ipmserver logs of it trying to connect. 

Steps:
To debug AD authentication
1) To enable logs for AD
	• login as ipmadmin user to GUI
	• go to /debug/ page
	• enable debug info for 'system' to value 1
2) then go to ssh -> command line and to watch command
	tail -f /var/log/ipmserver.log
3) log with AD account to GUI
<strong>	Note: all successful login are cached for about 10 minutes to avoid intensive talk to AD; so sometimes it is needed to wait to see new debug lines. </strong>
	
<ol>To debug AD authentication
<li>Enable logging for AD
	<ul><li>log as ipmadmin user to GUI
	<li>go to /debug/ page   <em><https://<solidserver>/debug</em>
	<li>enable debug info for 'system' to value 1</ul>    <em>towards bottom in <b>debug</b>section. change value to 1 then click set</em>
<li>then go to ssh -> command line and to watch command
	tail -f /var/log/ipmserver.log
<li>log with AD account to GUI
	<ul><em>Note:</em> all successful logins are cached for about 10 minutes to avoid intensive communication to AD; so in some cases a waiting period is needed to see new debug lines.</ul></ol>

Provide the results of the ipmserver.log in the ticket.

Thank you for your time during the GTM session.

Here is a summary :
 - The management is regularly doing zone transfers on corp.jabil.org in order to the content of the zone and compare what he has in his database.
Testing the zone transfer manually ( # dig axfr corp.jabil.org) sometimes result in Timeout due to a Refused sent by the Windows Server.

 - We modified the registry key value 'module.dns.refresh_zone.axfr.security_threshold' from 0 to 64.
It allows the Management to be less 'strict' for the zone transfer

As discussed, we need you to install the hotfix attached to this case. It should fix the issue with the Delayed create RR.

Here is the GTM for tomorrow 8 AM your time : 

1. Please join my meeting, Thursday, August 22, 2019 at 12:00 UTC

Thank you for your time and patience during the GTM session.

Here is a summary :
 - we installed a new hotfix on the Management server
 - we change the status of the zone 10.in-addr.arpa from 'Delayed create' to 'OK' by doing the change in the database. Once done, the synchronisation of the zone was correctly working and the Management can update the zone.
 - we confirm that the replication mechanism for the creation of PTR record now correctly create the PTR in the 10.in-addr.arpa.

We will keep this case open for the moment. Please monitor the situation and keep us updated if needed.

50241,260341,JABIL,"Hello Chris,

Yes, I confirm you have to install the hotfix for the hot Standby.
See below the steps to reproduce to install the hotfix for the Hot Standby:
 
1. Upload the file to the Hot Standby Management server via Administration >
Maintenance > Local files listing

2. Connect in ssh on the Hot Standby Management server and change to root
% su

3. Install the hotfix
# sh /data1/exports/EIP_HF_49944.sh install

4. In case of any issue, you can rollback with :
# sh /data1/exports/EIP_HF_49944.sh uninstall

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP Support Team regarding LDAP authentication.

Once you configured the users authentication rule the system will be ready to provide secure connection for external users, just make sure the groups that you created in SOLIDserver is matching the group names for the external users in the remote directory, when the user use his username and password SOLIDserver will use the authentication rule to authenticate the user. if the authentication was successful the user rights will be based on the group they belong to.  

More information is available in (SOLIDserver Administrator Guide/Managing Authentication Rules).

Please let me know if you have any further question.

50275,259022,Baxo Systems,"Hi Tarek:

I've been perfomed more tests and below I'm going to detail what I encountered.

- I used LDAPAdmin to test the connection to the ldap server with the bind user configured on IPAM Server. That means, IPAMUSER.
Please see the file named   LdapAdmin configuration.JPG

- Connected int the ldap server with IPAMUSER I performed a search of the user CTI22226, and it was found correclty. Please see
files named ""Finding the user CTI22226.JPG"" and ""User CTI22226 properties.JPG"". As you can see IPAMUSER can navigate the tree.

- After the tests using LDAPAdmin, I configured the authenitcation rule on IPAM Server, using the same parameters as before (LDAPAdmin).
Please see the file named ""Authentication Rule configuration.JPG"".

- Then I tried to login into the IPAM GUI, with the user ""CTI22226"" and the login failed. Please see the debuggin into the file named ""debug_09082019.txt"".
As you can see the system is saying that it's unable to run a search on LDAP Server, but using other application we're able to search the users.
Another doubt that I have is why the script used by the application is called: ""LDAP_anonymous_auth.php"", because we're using a Bind user, but also if I try to navigate the tree with Anonymous connection, using LDAPADmin, I can't navigate the tree.

Please I need to give an answer to the customer MOnday morning.

I'll be waiting your contact.

Thank you for the files provided.

From the packet captures we did last friday I can see that when you try to connect using your test account, Solidserver will search for this user using the attribute uid.

From the file IPAM_ldap.txt, I see that there is no attribute uid in the LDAP. I can't confirm this is the issue here, but it can be an explanation.

I may had misunderstood what you were saying. I was implying that if you want to get information regarding logins from the command line you could execute the command as in example below:

This is for the operating system logins, not the GUI logins, you need to use the session tracking to list the GUI logins. 

Hope that clarify's it for you.

    Ok, I understood the login and user logout of both the GUI and the Shell, I can see it only by commands, with the commands you passed me. This is clear to me.

   Now, returning to the original query, I set it to be sent to Claro's external syslog ""ipmserver.log"", ""ipmserver-rules.log"" and ""auth.log"" why this not work, I have some way to verify that it is working or that it is well configured?

<em>Notes</em> 
Reviewing the backup:
- no dhcp servers
- no dns servers
Network 192.168.10.0/24
- example 192.168.10.110 - IP address type - 'Regular' - only managed in IPAM
      - <em>In use</em> address is already assigned.
<pre>'Discover networks' determines which IP addresses are already being used on your physical network so they can be assigned as already being used - so you won't assign them by mistake to another device or think they are 'free' (free meaning - the ip address can be assigned).</pre>

In your backup, I see 15  regular type ip address in 192.168.10.0/24.  Since I'm not connected to your network and if I were to ping these devices, I would get back ping timeout errors.

I could then go to 'All networks' (Red LAN) and run 'discovered networks' and it would not remove these devices, only assign any new devices that are using IP addresses.

You would need to physically go through and delete the IP address 'In Use' that you do not want anymore.  SOLIDserver does not have a way to know that the client isn't turned off, the network is down, etc.  

There is a way to do something similar to this, but you would need Professional Services to write the customization.  They could set up a way to run a cron job that would look for clients that have not been seen for the number of days set.

Before doing the steps in the above note. Please answer.
- Which kind of sub-interfaces do they want to see?
- Are they using snmp v3 to manage network devices? If not, the network capture will be more helpful than a TS dump.

If you need to do a Network capture
<b>To perform a network capture</b>

1. Go to the Administration tab.
2. In the menu, click on Tools > Network capture. The Perform a network capture wizard
opens.
3. In the drop-down list Predefined, you can select one of three options described below:

	DNS traffic: Select this option to scan the DNS traffic. The field Port is automatically filled with 53.</pre>
	
4. In the drop-down list Interface, select the interface for which you want to capture packets.
    It can either be DEFAULT_INTERFACE or the DHCP_INTERFACE.
5. In the field Port, you can specify the port for which you want to capture packets.
6. In the field IP address, you can specify the IP address for which you want to capture packets.
7. In the drop-down list Protocol, you can specify the protocol, either udp, tcp or both (Any).
8. In the drop-down list Duration, you can specify the duration of the capture, either 10s, 30s,

2. The customer sent just plain text command output not a network capture

I suggest to do manual capture if you are familiar with shell command line:
1. run from ssh termial (as root): 
tcpdump -i <interface_name> -w /data1/exports/dump_10.2.191.6.pcap host 10.2.191.6
2. select the device 10.2.191.6 from netchange GUI and refresh it.
3. when refresh finished, stop tcpdump (by Ctrl-C)
4. you can download the file dump_10.2.191.6.pcap in GUI > Administration > Maintenace > Local files listing

If you're not familiar with command line, use the GUI menu: NetChange > Tools > Make a snapshot
Put the ip address, shoose the correct snmp profile (v1 or v2 only) and 'OK'.

If you have trouble to make capture, we can assist you during a GTM.

   Of Claro they ask me if there is an API to change the IPAM web user passwords through an external application such as PasswordSafe.

   If the API does not exist, can this change of password be made through any Operating System command (by SSH or a local Windows user or AD)?

   In either case, could you tell me how to do it?

   From Claro are asking me that they want to upgrade the IPAM to the latest version. Because I never did an upgrade I wanted to see what are the recommended procedures to do so. We would be updating from the current version (6.0.2.P3a) to the last one that came out 7.1.1a.

   I wanted to know if the backup from the Web-GUI interface is enough for a return. I am going to ask you to perform a full VMWare backup before upgrading (I think it is the fastest return in case of any inconvenience). What do you suggest?

   Do you need to upgrade intermediate versions? We have defined two users at the operating system level, could these be lost with the upgrade?

Thanks for contacting EfficientIP regarding upgrade.

We recommend testing upgrades in a lab environment prior to production implementation. EfficientIP also offers Professional Services to assist with upgrades as it's out of scope for support. If customers are performing their own upgrade it's best to view the upgrade procedures and release notes. 

We recommend upgrading to the latest version of your current Major version prior to upgrading to a newer Major version.  There's a possibility that an upgrade may overwrite some files in which case you may need to re-add the cli users.

Are all of the IP addresses in with this issue of the Type: Network?  
By default the Network address should not be assigned, except in IPv4 networks with /31 and /32 networks. To make the /31 or /32 Network address assignable refer to the SOLIDserver Administration Guide section: Assigning the Broadcast or Network addresses.
By default, the IPv4 terminal networks with a prefix smaller than /30 (more than 4 addresses) are created with a Network address and Broadcast address that are both Nonassignable.

A registry database entry allows making them both assignable.  In the section: To make the Broadcast and Network addresses of a network assignable provides steps to edit the

I've verified that even with the regex modification the wizard will not accept a space in the I/P address name field by design. This is enforced because of the replication mechanisms in place. We do not recommend having a space in the name as this could cause issues in the future if you decide to utilize the replication advantages. If you are able to import with a space in the name, you can choose to utilize that method as a work around but it is not supported and may prevent replication to function properly in the future for those records.

For Huahpict15 example, it looks the Lease was pushed to IPAM with no name but has the rest of the data. It is not adding the name in ipam because the name is already associated with a different mac-address.

Being these are Microsoft DHCP servers we can't get troubleshooting dumps.  Would you be able to provide the dhcpd.log equivalent in Microsoft to follow the events of these to mac-addresses?

For Huahpict15,  the lease is 10.115.64.249

So the lease should update 10.115.64.249 in IPAM 

In <b>IPAM</b> this IP is in the Network 'Quarantine Network HUA001-BD01' 
pool 'Dhcp' [10.115.64.6 - 10.115.65.254]; 
and the pool is supposed to update DNS and create DHCP Range which we see that it does.
The IP 10.115.64.249 
NO NAME   <-----
mac 6c:3b:e5:23:03:61 

In DNS: The lease updates DNS with:
The A record huahpict15.corp.jabil.org (10.115.64.249)
The PTR record 
PTR 249.64.115.10.in-addr.arpa (huahpict15.corp.jabil.org)
========
======== IP address 10.114.112.125
The 10.114.112.125 (huahpict15.corp.jabil.org) IP address in IPAM
Mac address is f4:39:09:0d:d7:4b  which is different from what is coming from DHCP.
It has the shortname huahpict15
It's DHCP pool [10.114.112.61 - 10.114.113.27] is read-only it creates a range and updates DNS. 
So if IPAM updated DNS it should have the A record 10.114.112.125 with FQDN huahpict15.corp.jabil.org.  But it doesn't the FQDN is with 10.115.64.249 for huahpict15...

The DNS associates 10.114.112.125.
 With A record cnhuawh221.corp.jabil.org (10.114.112.125)
IPAM has the name: cnhuawh221.corp.jabil.org has the IP address - 10.114.113.130 name: cnhuawh221.corp.jabil.org : mac - ec:b1:d7:3f:55:c0

Back to the IP address 10.114.112.125 it has the mac address f4:39:09:0d:d7:4b

51723,270182,JABIL,"Hello Chris, Zhiwei,

The quickest option should be to delete the IPs 10.114.112.225 and 10.115.134.73 from the IPAM module.
Then, in the DHCP module, in ""All leases"", select the IPs 10.115.64;249 and 10.115.66.91, then Tools > Expert > Initialize Rules. It should correctly update the IPAM and the DNS.

Regarding Netchange, it is possible these IPs have been previously created in the IPAM by Netchange and can't be updated by the DHCP module.

51764,0,JABIL,The API for DNS record edit/removal demands a mandatory input named rr_name. The problem is that field is actually named rr_full_name on the back end. You can test this easily with the list method since that lets you use either and rr_full_name is the one that works. On edit or delete you have to use rr_name but obviously  it fails to find a record with rr_name equal to anything since rr_name doesn't even exist.

Below is a sample curl command that you would execute from your management server to one of your DHCP servers.

As root user, type the following command to check communication from management to remote DHCP:

# curl -u admin:admin --insecure https://xx.xx.xx.xx/cmd/dhcp/get_dhcpd_conf_time.php

   Sorry but I didn't understand, do I have to use the DHCP IP that Claro uses? Because Claro does not use the SOLIDServer as DHCP.

   How can I know that you are trying to use an API?

   Sorry but I don't have the programmer profile and it's hard for me to understand sometimes.

51798,271038,Baxo Systems,"Hi Martin, 

That is just an example. let's go back to your original request:

 Claro is doing some tests with people from PasswordSafe against IPAM. A user was generated and they are trying to make this query from a RedHat:

curl -i -sS -k -c /dev/null -X GET -H 'cache-control: no-cache' -u pruebaps:'Pru3b3PS.$2019' ""https://10.105.125.14/rest/user_info"" [^] --tlsv1.2

   As a result of the command they get the following message:

***********************************************************************
As you can see from the result that's posted - This is a successful call !!!!! The server responded !!!!!
************************************************************************
  
They tell me that it is a problem of user permissions that they use, what kind of permissions would they need to give the user so that they can perform this query?
************************************************************************

Tell them to use user admin in the query if they need more permissions!!!!

    Claro reports differences in the same report taken on 11/14/2019 (see file export_excel_20191114-144233.xls) and on 11/22/2019 (see file export_excel_20191122-171213.xls).

    In the first case you can see for example, the first three networks:

Address + prefix IP Used (%) Used Subnet Used (%)
131.0.212.0/22 N / A 1024 100%
131.100.108.0/22 N / A 964 94.1%
131,100,184.0/22 N / A 903 88.2%

and in the second case:

Address + prefix Size Used Subnet Used (%)
131.0.212.0/22 1024 0 0%
131,100,108.0/22 1024 0 0%
131,100,184.0/22 1024 904 88.3%

    Why it may be that in networks 131.0.212.0/22 and 131.100.108.0/22 they look like ""Subnet Used (%)"" 100% and 94.1% respectively and then 0% and 0% (in the second report if the networks not have been deleted)?

    The problem that Claro poses is: why does the same report, only with a difference of days, first show information and a few days later show another?
	
   For our customer (Claro), is very important to be able to visualize the reports with necesary information, since the report is the tool where they can show internally that this is a good solution and they invest correctly.

I see you are reporting on both terminal and non-terminal networks. You need to filter and only report on the terminal networks that hold all the I/P's. I've attached screen shots to ticket. For example 131.0.212.0 is a /22 which is a Non-terminal network which contains four /24 terminal networks.131.0.212.0/24, 131.0.213.0/24, 131.0.214.0/24 and 131.0.215.0/24 these hold all the I/P's. Non-terminal networks are for creating the terminal networks that hold the I/P's.

Looks to me that it's reporting the subnet used % not the IP used % which makes sense to me. Not sure what you are expecting to see. Please provide additional information with exact specifics. 

Just to recap, a terminal network is basically a container to break your larger networks down to manageable subnets, then terminal networks house the actual I/P's. Does that make sense?

   I am having an error in my laboratory environment when wanting to add a network and it gives me the following error:

Network type: Subnet
Parent network: /0 ()
Error
Missing parameter(s) [site_id/site_name/parent_subnet_id]

   Please see attached image ""Error00.PNG"". The ""BAXO"" space generates it without problems, see files Error01.PNG & Error02.PNG.

   If it helps, we made two major changes to try two things we need in Claro, I comment to see if the problem can be locked up. One was the implementation of the HA, and the other the aggregate of the Pingsweeper.

   I repeat, this happened in our laboratory environment and we can do the tests they need, I can also give them access to it.

   Some time ago, in the ticket ""0050496: Add a SuperUser in FreeBSD"" you explained how to add a user ""sypkfunc"" that Claro needs. The problem is that after the upgrade to version 7.1.1a the ""/ home / sypkfunc"" apparently was lost (see attachment ""sypkfunc user.PNG"").

   How can I rebuild this folder in the SOLIDServer?

Since I worked the original ticket I'll go ahead and take this off your hands.

52526,275438,Baxo Systems,"Hi Martin,

You'll need to re-add the user again, It turns out that when adding a new user through the CLI option you need to change the default of the home directory from the default to /data1/users/username

The directory /data1/users is saved in the upgrade process but /home/user is not.

Sorry for any inconvenience. 

Kind regards,

Tim Gormley",public,tim.gormley@efficientip.com
52526,275603,Baxo Systems,"Hi Tim:

   I understand that I must generate the new user with the exception of changing the directory. Now the query is: will the same happen for every update?

From what I see the user exists because I can login, can't the ""/home/sypkfunc"" folder be generated instead of generating the user again?

Regards,

Martin",public,mp@baxosystems.com
52526,275615,Baxo Systems,"Hi Martin,

So the problem with creating /home/sypkfunc directory is that it will not contain the required shell login files and /home directory is not saved during an upgrade. Thats the reason it's best to recreate the user giving them the home directory of /data1/users/username because the directory /data1/users is saved during an upgrade.

Kind regards,

Tim Gormley",public,tim.gormley@efficientip.com
52526,275616,Baxo Systems,"Hi Tim:

   OK I understand. Please just confirm if it can happen again in a future upgrade, because Claro is going to ask me, and I clarify that.

As long as the users home directory is moved to /data1/users/sypkfunc it will be saved during upgrade. See screen shot attached to ticket.

Thanks for uploading the file, Versioning allows to automatically save all the changes in the configuration files, and all the revisions of the files are saved in SOLIDserver backup file.

   Claro is asking me the following. They need an example of how to do, through the implementation of API / Python, the addition of the first available network / 30 in a space (in the attached example 10.6.0.0/30 of space 10.6.0.0/16 which is divided into two networks / 17, see ""API example.png"").

Thank you.

Martin",public,mp@baxosystems.com
52945,279400,Baxo Systems,"Hi Martin,

Without engaging professional services I was able to get the generalized flow of how to create the request based on the example provided.

They propose to:
 
Use the ip_block_subnet_list with a where clause to identify the block that the /30 will be created under.  

In their example maybe use the address and prefix to search for the /16

-        Use the ip_find_free_subnet call to check if there is a /30 that can be created directly under the /16.  This step may not be necessary if they never want to create /30 at this level but only under the next level (ie in the /17s).  In the example they supplied this call will not return anything because there isn’t any available space under the /16.  The sum of the /17s make up the entire /16.

-        Use the ip_block_subnet_list with the parent_subnet_id in the where clause to find the child blocks.  In the example, the block id of the /16 is used as the parent_subnet_id in this call and the call will return the two /17s.  An order by clause may also be necessary here if they want to search the child blocks in a specific order

-        Use the ip_find_free_subnet call to search each of the child blocks for an available /30

-        When a /30 is identified, use the ip_subnet_add call to create the subnet.

As previously stated if they are looking for assistance in creating complicated API calls,  that would require a Professional Services engagement.

The issue is now resolved, the DNS cache server was answering with the DNS entry from his cache (so the old entry). Once the entry in the cache expired, the DNS cache server gets the new IP. This is a normal behavior.

We saw how to manually flush the cache.

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP technical support.

From the statistics you have provided we can see that the DNS response time for 'National DNS' on Broadband Fibre is the same between 15/02 and 16/02. It means that the DNS server is responding correctly.

If there are bigger differences for the other types of connectivity (Copper/International), it means that the issue can come from somewhere else.

The development team was not working on fix, this ticket wasn't qualified.

As described in the documentation, the character * is a special character to search for every character.

There is no way to search specifically for the character ""*"" without changing all of SOLIDserver's filter system.

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP.

For information, the last release patch in version 6 is 6.0.2.P9 (28-February-2020). 
>>> Is this a must to intall this release?
Upgrading is not mandatory but we highly recommend it in order to benefit bug and security fixes.

>>> What will resolve or bugs found in the previous release?
Visit the web portal KB for this question: http://kb.efficientip.com/index.php/SOLIDserver_6.0.2

>>> Is there any outage? and how long will take to update each server?
As all upgrade software, a restart of the service will be required. The time it will take will depend on the size of the DB.

By the way, we strongly encourage you to validate your upgrade in the LAB environment. It is the customer's responsibility to ensure system integrity before applying to the production.

regards,
lamees",public,lamees.jasim@btc.com.bh
53768,285116,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hello Lamees,

Best option to test how fast the DNS server replies is to :

1. Connect on the Management server CLI (maybe it is on the same subnet as the DNS server or very close to it)

2. Do your dig tests:
# dig @dns_server_ip www.google.com

3. Check the Query time at the bottom of the answer

If there is latency on the network (switches, routers, etc...), I'm afraid we can't help you on that.

Kind regards,
Remi

   Claro report problems in the report, if you look at the graph IPAM_2.png, network 131.0.212.0/22, has 4 networks / 24, however in the ""Network Use"" column it shows me 0%. This is also reflected in the report, see attached form ""export_excel_20200227-104450.xls"".

   Why do you visualize it wrong, if this has been done correctly for a while? I had previously reported this but due to a problem of delay in Claro's answers, the case was closed. Claro really needs this to be displayed correctly.

Thank you very much in advance,

   In Claro many times they use the same IP NAME for three different IPs: ""Loopback"" of ""mgmt"" and ""IGP"". When they try to do this by the Web GUI interface it gives the following error (see attached file Error.png).

For the user to be able to use the same name the rule 102 'checking uniqueness of an IP address name' needs  'Prevent creation' changed to 'No'.

This sets the error message severity level when users try to add duplicate entries: 'No' allows users to create duplicate entries. A warning message is returned after the creation to indicate that the entry already exists.

The ""devd"" logs start at the lowest level boot process. Generally, these messages are appearing when the guest has a ""CD/DVD Drive"" listed in its hardware on ESX. therefore in order to avoid it, you can unplug the CDROM from VMware.

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP support,

Before you jump in to last patch of next version, i would suggest you to upgrade your server to the first patch of version 7 to avoid database inconsistency , then you can directly upgrade your server to the last patch.

I highly recommend you to test this upgrade in your lab, before play with production environment

For me you should more answer something like (I think he wants to stay in v6 branch):

o If you want to stay in the same branch (v6) you can install 6.0.2.P9a directly
o If you want to upgrade to v7 you should install 6.0.2.P9a then 7.1.4a as mentioned in the upgrade guide:
   
   Upgrading an Appliance from Version 6.0.x
   To upgrade an appliance, whether Standalone or Management appliance, from version 6.0.x to7.1, you need to:
    1.Download the image of the latest patch of version 6.0.2.
    2.Upgrade the appliance to version 6.0.2.
    3.Save the backup file generated during the upgrade.
    4.Download the image of the latest patch of version 7.1.
    5.Upgrade the appliance to version 7.1.
    6.Save the backup file generated during the upgrade.

And of course as you did ""I highly recommend you to test this upgrade in your lab"", it's perfect.

For the remaining issue with the VIP, here is what you have to check :

=================
SOLIDserver allows you to set up virtual IP addresses (VIP) on supported services. This mechanism, known as Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP) is a protocol which allows multiple EfficientIP devices on the same local network to share a single IP addresse or the same set of addresses. Its primary purpose is to provide failover redundancy. For example, if there is a single SOLIDserver running a DNS service and it goes down, then, the networks on each side of the DNS service can no longer communicate with each other, or, they communicate without any DNS service. However, if there are two EfficientIP devices running CARP, if one fails, the other can take over with SOLIDserver on either side of the DNS service not being aware of the
failure. Operations continue as normal. Note that through a VIP you can manage DNS smart architectures Master/Slave and Multi-Master.

The general idea is to have a single IP address, and several physical servers behind. In the case of a failure, the next available server takes the lead and provides the relevant services. This mechanism is available for DNS, NTP, TFTP services and SOLIDserver management.

Please note that with virtual appliances, the VMware ESXi host vSwitch must be configured as follows:
• The option Promiscuous mode must be enabled,
• The option MAC Address Changes must be enabled,
• The option Forged Transmits must be enabled,
• The option Net.ReversePathFwdCheckPromisc must be set to 1.
=================

As you have migrated your VMs to new ESXi host, we had to regenerate licences.
We also reconfigured HA replication as it was not working correctly.

- We found that DNS CPU load is very high on the 2 loaded server cache1 & cache2 (193.188.97.210 & 193.188.97.211) and its reaching over 95% for first server and 90% for the second server for about 12 hours daily .

- The DNS query latency issue found using namebench tool is correlated to the CPU issue and number of query on the 2 loaded server.

 -  Most of the DNS quires hits are aligned with the below:
 89% found to be on DNS (193.188.97.210 & 193.188.97.211), and 10% is on DNS (193.188.97.197 & 193.188.97.212), remaining 1% is on DNS (193.188.97.193 & 193.188.97.209)

-	Our Fixed network (BRAS) :  
Using DNS (193.188.97.210) as Primary, and DNS (193.188.97.211) as Secondary similarly in both location . Max connected users is 115K

-	Mobile: 
Using DNS (193.188.97.210, 193.188.97.211, 193.188.97.197, 193.188.97.212) in 4 locations . However, its using load sharing on 2 DNS for each location. Max active users is ~400k

Please advice.
1-  Why you recommended to use caches DNS only (193.188.97.210, 193.188.97.211) for the customers ? Also to confirm that there is no issue/risk to use other DNS for the customer. 
2- Is the CPU load normal or abnormal? What is the solution?
3- Is above analysis will affect also in the DNS query latency ?

Lamees

 

",public,lamees.jasim@btc.com.bh
54378,291009,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hello Lamees,

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP support,

1 - Caching DNS server is a server that handles recursive requests from clients. Almost every DNS server that the operating system’s stub resolver will contact will be a caching DNS server.

Caching servers have the advantage of answering recursive requests from clients efficiently and reduce your bandwidth as well. While authoritative-only servers may be ideal for serving specific zone information, caching DNS servers are more broadly useful from a client’s perspective. They make the DNS system of the world accessible to rather dumb client interfaces.

To avoid having to take the performance hit of issuing multiple iterative request to other DNS servers every time it receives a recursive request, the server caches its results. This allows it to have access to a broad base of DNS information (the entire world’s publicly accessible DNS) while handling recent requests very quickly.

Access to the entire range of public DNS data -  All zone data served by publicly accessible DNS servers hooked into the global delegation tree can be reached by a caching DNS server. It knows about the root DNS servers and can intelligently follow referrals as it receives data.

Maintains a cache of recently requested data -  By caching the results as it collects them from other DNS servers for its client requests, a caching DNS server builds a cache for recent DNS data. Depending on how many clients use the server, how large the cache is, and how long the TTL data is on the DNS records themselves, this can drastically speed up DNS resolution in most cases.

2 - CPU load could be normal as you mentioned that there are heavy load of users are accessing server at the peak time

3 - I'm not quite sure about DNS query latency

   The problem originally reported in the case ""0053862: Network Use problem"" was repeated, the occupation of the networks is poorly displayed (see attached images ""problem1.png"" and ""problem2.png""). Could this be a problem solved in any of the new releases?

   I copy below the text written in the case ""0053862: Network Use problem"":

====

Dear Team:

   Claro report problems in the report, if you look at the graph IPAM_2.png, network 131.0.212.0/22, has 4 networks / 24, however in the ""Network Use"" column it shows me 0%. This is also reflected in the report, see attached form ""export_excel_20200227-104450.xls"".

   Why do you visualize it wrong, if this has been done correctly for a while? I had previously reported this but due to a problem of delay in Claro's answers, the case was closed. Claro really needs this to be displayed correctly.

Thank you very much in advance,

Thank you for joining the GTM session today, during the session we did general check the slave cache DNS servers and we noticed both server were in OK status and synchronized, we preformed couple of tests and we did check for the logs, the DNS service was up and running without any issues.

We activated querylog/answerlog and we focused on couple pf play station clients and we didn't see any resolving problems with these clients.

As we discussed I will set the priority back to P2 since no service issue currently and lets keep monitoring the system in the next couple of days, during the meeting I requested TS dump from one of the DNS servers, please upload the file to the following link.

Thank you for joining the GTM session today, during the session we did general check the slave cache DNS servers and we noticed both server were in OK status and synchronized, we preformed couple of tests and we did check for the logs, the DNS service was up and running without any issues.

We activated querylog/answerlog and we focused on couple pf play station clients and we didn't see any resolving problems with these clients.

As we discussed I will set the priority back to P2 since no service issue currently and lets keep monitoring the system in the next couple of days, during the meeting I requested TS dump from one of the DNS servers, please upload the file to the following link.

regarding the high CPU readings, we are still following up the case through ticket https://support.efficientip.com/issuetracker/view.php?id=54378, I will check with my colleague and get back to you as soon as possible.

Anyway. My observations below:


The rejected DNS queries are conform with your configuration.

For instance:

May 12 00:03:07 cache1 named[34419]: client @0x47e7a800 87.236.136.3#49982 (mblcdn-callofduty-com.akamaized.net): query (cache) 'mblcdn-callofduty-com.akamaized.net/A/IN' denied

The client address 87.236.136.3 is filtered by the following statement configuration:

	allow-query-cache {
		BahrainACL;
		127.0.0.1/32;
		192.168.1.0/24;
		164.138.27.101/32;
	};

87.236.136.3 is not belonging to BahrainACL

The DNS behavior is normal.

Please review your BahrainACL configuration.
This configuration is definitively the responsibility of Batelco.

I have uploaded the files. I have one query , on the slave servers we have allow-query-cache set as ""any"" in the access control , does this mean that slave servers are allowed to query our cache DNS. If we disable this (set this to none) what will be the impact. 

We have diverted some chunk of our subscriber traffic from caches to slave servers to reduce CPU utilization but we don't see CPU utilization going down.

Slave servers have recursion enabled. Will they be able to serve the query for subscribers same as slave servers.

54407,293949,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hi Naseer, 

The recommended method is to create ACLs that match hosts that should be allowed access to cache and recursion on the servers. 

For example, if you wanted to provide recursion and access to the cache to clients you trusted, you could list them in an ACL such as the following:

acl ""trusted"" {
     192.168.0.0/16;
     10.153.154.0/24;
     localhost;
     localnets;
 };
 
 options {
     ...
     allow-query { any; };
     allow-recursion { trusted; };
     allow-query-cache { trusted; };
     ...
 };

Therefore, as per your configuration, you can set ""batelcoACL"" in the ""Allow-query-cache"" as well.

2. If we can use our slave servers instead of cache 

The previous query to rephrase is , are our slave servers querying our cache , the reason is after diverting the a good amount of subscribers traffic to slave DNS , still the queries per second on the cache is around 22k and it has not reduced. Still CPU is 90% above.

1. From the DNS Statistics, we can see that the Hit Cache is about 95%, which is good. So 5% of the queries needs to perform recursion.
Maybe, you can have more Cache Hit by increasing the cache size. Currently it is set to 1GB. You can set it to 2 GB and see if the percentage of queries needing recursion decrease a little bit over the time.

The current CPU usage is in relation with the amount of queries per seconds. Currently you have about 20k qps - 22k qps. The CPU usage you see is expected.

2. Can you tell me to which DNS servers, subscribers DNS traffic has been redirected (name and IP of the DNS server) ?

1. For point 1 , let me know which statistics you are referring too and how we can get that stats. What is the procedure to increase cache size and what will be the impact on the server. Will it bring down CPU usage. The appliance is SDS1100 and should be capable of handling 50 K queries per sec , 22 K is not even half of it. Our concern is that with 90% usage it is dropping queries from the client and if it hits almost 100% it will be unresponsive and cause an outage.
2. Below are the IP of the slave servers and the traffic diverted is to ns3 and ns4.

54407,294084,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hello Naseer,

1. Statistics can be seen in the properties of the DNS server in the Management GUI. You have a box 'DNS Server Statistics'.
Having a bigger cache can help by reducing a little bit the need to do recursion, so it could help by reducing the CPU usage. But don't expect that it will reduce the CPU usage a lot.

To increase the cache size : Go to the properties of the Smart  recursive.batelco.dns.smart > in the box 'OPTIONS' click on Edit > change the value of Max-cache-size from 1024m to 2048m.

In CLI on the DNS server, can you please use the command :
# top

And check the value of idle 
CPU:  0.5% user,  0.0% nice,  2.7% system,  0.0% interrupt, <b>96.8% idle</b>

54407,294123,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hi 

The reason to raise this ticket is to find the solution for 90% usage of CPU and to see if this is causing any lookup failures. We are still not concluding that.  Can we conclude on that based on all the logs and information we have provided. We suspect that when it reaches 90% and above it is causing issues with resolution. Is there any suspicious traffic causing the issue , are the available resources exhausted , is there any bug etc.

Plus one basic query that I asked was based on our architecture does slave servers query the cache of ours since they queries on them have increased but cache queries per second has not decreased while we have moved considerable chunk of subscribers to query slave servers.

Can we get straight forward replies.

From the backup of the Management I have, ns3 and ns4 are not forwarding the queries to the cache servers, so ns3 and ns4 are doing recursion and caching for subscribers using them as DNS servers.

Additional information which is not related directly to the issue of this ticket, is that ns3 and ns4 (193.188.97.193 and 193.188.97.209) can answers from their cache information to everyone on Internet.

You should limit allow-query-cache to your subscribers only if you consider using ns3 or ns4 as recursive servers.

Now, back to the CPU usage for your cache servers. Checking the Load Average Statistics, we can see that the CPU usage of the cache server has been pretty high since a long time. But, from April 15th, there was an increase of DNS traffic (see screenshot dns_traffic.jpg). This cause an increase of the CPU usage (screenshot cpu_usage.jpg). In the meantime, DNS queries per seconds keep the same trend (about 20k qps in peak hours).

Do you know if there was any change made on 15th April ?

Before moving traffic to name servers that are not intended for acting as recursive/cache servers, it is better to take a look at your cache servers configuration.

If you confirm me that cache1.batelco.com.bh and cache2.batelco.com.bh are dedicated to Batelco subscribers, so I should not be able to query those DNS from my ISP. But it is the case, even if I get a REFUSED answer, my DNS query goes to your DNS server and it consumes his resources.

You should first define an ACL for the allow-query statement (from the TS dump and the backup, allow-query is set to any).
And if there is a firewall between Internet and your DNS servers, UDP and TCP connections on port 53 destinated to your DNS servers should also be limited to only your subscribers IP.

Finally the high CPU is normal behaviour based on the traffic can you please confirm that or is there anything more that can be done.

Thanks. 
From the ticket history we can draw following conclusions , just to summarize:
1. Based on traffic on cache CPU is expected to peak
2. We need to set ACL on the slave similar to cache ( BatelcoACL)
3. allow-query is set to Any on the Cache servers need to set to BatelcoACL
3. We can increase the cache size for the cache servers
4. set ""batelcoACL"" in the ""Allow-query-cache"" as well for the slave servers
5. DNS Statistics, we can see that the Hit Cache is about 95%, which is good. So 5% of the queries needs to perform recursion
6. From the backup of the Management I have, ns3 and ns4 are not forwarding the queries to the cache servers, so ns3 and ns4 are doing recursion and caching for subscribers using them as DNS servers

Regarding query for the 15th April , it is due to increase of subscribers that are querying cache servers. 

We will have to schedule the changes based on approval from the management.

*History recall:*
Their Authoritative DNS is a mix of Authoritative DNS/Recursive as Batelco provided these IPs to end-customers without good control. That's the reason why recursion opened as now.

Their Recursive DNS is paired with VIP DNS with VIP getting majority of DNS queries.

Recommendation:

  * Good usage case for DNS Guardian (Batelco is Telco as all other we
    know) - will take time 
In the meantime:

  * a lot of NXDomain queries can be stopped immediately by implementing
    root slave zone directly on cache 1 and cache2 (similar like AIS)
  * increase max-memory - low for such traffic and we can increase
  * agree on applying to top 5 talkers (ending in denied) on ipfw ->
    even SOLIDserver
    In theory, release restriction would make these clients to stop
    doing query - *we can apply same list as in allow-recursion (drop rest)*

Latest agreement in ticket is very good. If you want, feel free to share analyze traffic from this email.

Even if I get a 'REFUSED' as answer, this DNS query reaches your DNS server.

Regarding point 1. and the creation of a slave root zone, here is the procedure :

1. Go to the DNS tab
2. Click on the Smart cache
3. Add a new zone :
DNS zone type : Slave
DNS zone resolution : Name
Name : .    <-- dot
Master IP address : 192.0.32.132 and 192.0.47.132

For implementing root zone does it have any impact on the cache servers. What is the rollback plan.
Regards,
Naseer",public,naser.khan@btc.com.bh
54407,297286,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hello Naseer,

Implementing root zone will have an impact on the server, this is why we ask you do add it. All DNS queries with unknown top level domain will be replied with NXDOMAIN directly. It will avoid your DNS server to perform an unnecessary query to the DNS root servers.

The rollback procedure is to simply remove the root zone you created.

We have troubleshooting dump already uploaded for that period. 
We will implement the root slave zone in the coming week , what is the roll back plan and will there be any impact in terms of regular queries to the DNS and the rules on the firewall already exist.

Naseer",public,naser.khan@btc.com.bh
54407,299348,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hello Naseer,

For the issue you add on 23 April (youtube video), you can do the following on your DNS server :

==========================
1. Connect in CLI and change to root :
% su

2. Edit the file /usr/local/nessy2/etc/named/options_include.conf
# vi /usr/local/nessy2/etc/named/options_include.conf

3. Add the line below :
tcp-listen-queue 50;

4. Restart named ipmdns.sh service :
# service ipmdns.sh restart
==========================

I'm asking you to do this becasue we can see the following line in /var/log/messages :

==========================
Apr 23 06:49:43 cache1 kernel: sonewconn: pcb 0xfffff8004d709740: Listen queue overflow: 16 already in queue awaiting acceptance (1 occurrences)
Apr 23 08:50:01 cache1 kernel: sonewconn: pcb 0xfffff8004d709740: Listen queue overflow: 16 already in queue awaiting acceptance (130 occurrences)
==========================

TCP queue is sometimes full, so doing the procedure above will increase the queue from 10 to 50.

About the root slave zone, as I already said, rollback is to delete the zone. The impact of having a root zone, is to avoid recursion for some queries where top level domain does not exist.

About the firewall rules, the example below shows that your firewall is not allowing only your subscribers, I can from my ISP do queries to your DNS server, and I think, you don't want any Internet public IPs being able to query your DNS server and it is the case currently :

54499,292036,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello Manseer,

As discussed, we can see that the DNS service is working well. The issue comes from the CARP, where the Master VIP interface is flapping.

It can be related to the Esxi configuration for the Net.ReversePathFwdCheckPromisc parameter. It as to be configured to 1.

==================
Problem of duplicate packet on VMware ESxi

Duplicate multicast packets are generated when the vSwitch has at least two vmnics and promiscuous mode enabled

Consider a vSwitch that has more than one uplink and has the promiscuous mode enabled. Some of the packets that come in from the uplinks that are not currently used by the promiscuous port, are not discarded. This behavior might mislead some applications, such as the CARP protocol instance.
This issue is resolved in this release. Starting with this release the Net.ReversePathFwdCheckPromisc configuration option is provided to explicitly discard all the packets coming in from the currently unused uplinks, for the promiscuous port.
Note: If the value of the Net.ReversePathFwdCheckPromisc configuration option is changed when the ESX instance is running, you need to enable or re-enable the promiscuous mode for the change in the configuration to take effect.
==================

Kind regards,
Remi",public,rb@efficientip.com
54499,292037,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello Manseer,

After setting Net.ReversePathFwdCheckPromisc and re-enabling promiscous mode, CARP interface is now okay and there is no more flapping.

As confirmed we are now closing this case.

============

To resolve the issue we restored the latest backup on the master then we reconfigured the HA again, we did final check, the configuration was successful and the system came back to normal.


As we discussed 7.0.2 is EOL version and not supported any more, we highly recommend to upgrade to our latest supported version 7.1.4c (20-May-2020) as best practice to take advantage of number of security fixes, performance improvements and bug fixes, we strongly encourage to validate the upgrade in LAB environment it is customer responsibility to ensure the system integrity.


We will wait the final confirmation from DNS team to make sure everything is ok, please feel free to update the ticket if you have any questions or concerns.

1) Need to know which right is required to add a new DHCP server.
2) What is wrong with the AD sync process?

Your ticketing system is evidently working. 

Your last question to me was ""Please let me know if further assistance is needed regarding this case."", to which I replied that you have supplied NO assistance so far to resolve this. Unfortunately, these issues did not magically resolve themselves.

So, how am I supposed to respond to these emails? Do I have to log into the support site every time to respond to an email, or is there something that I need to do to make my response get accepted?

I'm ultimately not sure why you'd ask if I need more assistance when no assistance was provided. I uploaded the backup as requested and then never heard back from you.

55100,297941,JABIL,"Hi Rob,

Regarding the first point I got a confirmation only users of the group admin can add new DHCP server, here I would like to draw your attention to the following points:

1- Adding new DHCP server require the SSH admin password of the appliance to configure the secure connection between the mangament and the server, so if an account know that password then he is admin in this case.

in other words if the user don't have admin permission to manage the appliance then he can't give that permission to the mangament appliance to manage the server

2- The user can't grant himself a permission for something doesn't exists yet since the server is not in the group resources yet, so after adding the server to the system the admin should add it as a resource to the group and configure the rights, thats way who add the server need to be in admin group.

3- only adding new server or smart require the admin group, after that you can give any group you want the permissions to manage the server. 

4- Adding new server usually is not a frequent task as adding scopes or ranges, or changing the DHCP options, so assign that task to one of the admins can be a suitable workaround for your need.


Regarding point 2, once the system admin configure the (AD group granted admin) the user who logged will atomically be added to the admin group to have the permission of the admin, if you find the user under that group it will have the permission of that group not the admin in this case.

For point 3, how to show the data in GUI is a relative preference,  currently you can see what (AD group granted the admin) from (GUI>Administration>Authentication rules) but if you want to see the same configuration from different page the developer may have a different point of view, it will be the same logic why can't we see the DHCP options from the DHCP all servers list, its located in a specific panel in server properties, the admin user who is responsible of the configuration should be able easily check the configuration at any time.

Please feel free to update the ticket if you have any questions or concerns.

Tarek

RE: ""1- Adding new DHCP server require the SSH admin password of the appliance to configure the secure connection between the mangament and the server, so if an account know that password then he is admin in this case.""

Yeah, DHCP admins are admins for DHCP services and servers, so they will have that access. When adding a new DHCP server, a connection is established to a DHCP server. That has nothing to do with the appliance ""Admin"" group rights.



RE: ""2- The user can't grant himself a permission for something doesn't exists yet since the server is not in the group resources yet, so after adding the server to the system the admin should add it as a resource to the group and configure the rights, thats way who add the server need to be in admin group.""

This makes no sense at all to me. You have a DNS module with rights specific to DNS. You have a DHCP module with rights specific to DHCP. If someone has been granted all the DHCP rights, they should be able to add a DHCP server in the DHCP module.


I am curious if there is something that can be done with rights on the modules?

Is there registry settings that may be hidden that allow for a customer to grant rights to add/remove DHCP servers so we don't have to give more people Admin rights?

Can you ask Remi?",private,tarek.alkattan@efficientip.com
55100,298475,JABIL,"Hi Rob,

Thanks for the feedback, this ticket has already been escalated since last week, as we discussed before, by design only administrators can create DNS/DHCP servers.

If you prefer a different behavior we can open a Request For Enhancement (RFE) ticket to suggest allowing  (grant rights to add/remove DHCP servers to non admin group), our R&D team will study and evaluate the request and depending on the evolution of the product this RFE might be implemented in a future version.

Thank you for contacting Efficient IP Support team regarding purge DNS and DHCP Data.

If its a LAB, its a good idea to re-install the product using the iso file from the following link:

https://mirror2.efficientip.com/support/downloads/SOLIDserver/7.2/7.2.0/

just make sure to export the license to re- import it later, and to save all the network configuration settings.

The other option if you don't want to go through the installation process is to reset the database from CLI by following the below steps:


1- Stop the services:

/usr/local/etc/rc.d/ipmserver.sh stop
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/postgresql stop

2- Reset the database:
rm -rf /data1/data/
?/usr/local/etc/rc.d/010.postgresql_init.sh start

Thanks for contacting EfficientIP regarding Phantom IPAM records. This may be related to the advanced properties settings. I've added a few screen shots and examples to ticket for you to check and review. It may be that the DHCP lease is conflicting or overwriting the iPAM entry.

Take a look at the screen shots attached and if you are still having issues I think I still have your backup and I'll try to setup in the lab to see if i can replicate it.

It sounds like they may have been added manually but unfortunately the logs may have turned over so we do not have a record of it. I can restore a recent backup and try to double check if you like, but if nothing is showing up in the user tracking or the current logs we may not be able to determine when exactly they were added. Are you experiencing this with any other records or just the original two?

Appreciate your urgent feedback on this issue as the client complained for the third time that all service providers are resolving the domain except Batelco. When we did the dig we found the server 193.188.97.209 could not resolve the domain while the other DNS slaves and caches are resolving

As a solution,  I flushed the server and resolved.

Please check and investigate as the client needs to know the root cause.

55825,302436,Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy,"Hello Manseer,

Thank you for contacting EfficientIP support

For information, despite the error message banner, all the service ( DHCP, DNS, NTP, ...) are not impacted. So you can continue to use SOLIDserver as usual. The only thing you cannot do is an upgrade.

So as mentioned in the 7.0 important notes: ""Now that the maintenance period is part of all licenses, it is no longer possible to upgrade SOLIDserver to a higher version or patch released after the maintenance period expired.”

That said, when upgrading to 7, the maintenance period is - by default - set to the Dec. 31st of 2019. If the maintenance period goes beyond the 12/31, then you have to request a new permanent license to have the period aligned.

Now regarding the renew, due to EU law on data protection GDPR regulations. We recommend you to fill out the following electronic form in order to generate a permanent license activation key also the maintenance contract is mandatory. 

Here's the link to access license request form: https://www.efficientip.com/license-request/ 

Once you will receive and activate the new license, please upgrade to version 7.2.1a (highly recommended due to the DHCP issue).

I am adjusting the case priority accordingly.

Each license key is unique and specific to one SOLIDserver appliance, you cannot use the same license key on several appliances.

 Thank you for uploading the file. When examining it, it looks as though you have sent a Trouble shooting dump for a different appliance than the one indicated. Can you please provide us with a trouble shooting dump for the servers cnhuam0dhcp01 and 02 with Managment backup. The following steps will outline how to correctly do that.

To generate and download the troubleshooting dump file
Only users of the group admin can perform this operation.

1. Open the GUI of the appliance then from the sidebar, click on Administration or Admin Home. The page Admin Home opens.


2. Generate the troubleshooting dump:

a. In the section Expert, click on Troubleshooting dump. The wizard Troubleshooting dump opens.
b. Tick the box(es) Retrieve DNS information, Retrieve DHCP information and/or Retrieve system information. The information ticked is included in the generated file.
c. Click on OK to complete the operation. The report opens and closes. The page Admin Home is visible again..


3. Download the file:

a. In the section Maintenance, click on Local files listing. The page opens.
b. Filter the column Name with the keyword DEBUG to only list troubleshooting dump files.
If a DEBUG file does not have the extension .tbz, it means it is not fully generated yet.
c. Click on the name of the file of your choice to download it.

If these steps are unclear to you at all, or you have any further questions please feel free to reach out to Efficient IP for more details.

  Thank you for joining the GTM earlier. We were able to realize, the reason you were missing logs, was because it was from an external, and our syslog in GUI will not report activity for externals, only rules that are applied. So with your permission we can close out this ticket. As for the auxiliary error found, would you mind please submitting a new ticket for that error. That way we can accurately track and trouble shoot that error separately. If you have more questions, or this is unclear to you at all, please feel free to reach out to Efficient IP.

56205,305683,JABIL,"In my mind these two tickets are the same.  I opened this ticket at the behest of EIP Support.  Regardless, it appears my ipmserver.rules.log file is rolling too quickly.",public,chris_ingle@jabil.com
56205,305700,JABIL,"Hi Chris,

I understand, depending on the size of your /var partition typically the log rotation is setup to prevent filling up /var.

You may be able to adjust a little bit if you need to try and keep additional logs.

It's controlled by file eip_newsyslog.conf

You can change the the number of kept files in the log by modifying the file /etc/newsyslog.conf.d/eip_newsyslog.conf 

The second number represents the number of log files to store. You can check if this is set for ipmserver-rules.log in your configuration and or try to add.

Example:
/var/log/postgresql.log 644 3 51200 * C
/var/log/httpd-access.log 644 2 51200 * J /var/run/httpd.pid 30
/var/log/httpd-error.log 644 2 51200 * J /var/run/httpd.pid 30
/data1/exports/sysaudit.log 644 4 51200 * C
=====
The column that contain the number of rotation is (3,2,2,4).

# service syslog-ng restart -  needed after the change.

Please take a backup before making any changes and verify you are using syslog-ng prior to making any adjustments.

Please help us, instead of requesting ""remote support"" directly take the time to answer the question accurately.

The error you faced is normal as you can't send any RNDC command to a SMART, you should only tick
the physical server when doing a ""clear cache"" (SMART has no cache, this is a virtual DNS architecture
as explained in any EIP training session).

My colleague told you to clear the cache then try to resolve again ""knowledgehub.josoorinstitute.qa"" but you
didn't answer that point (we need to see the command output).

On your query (in the attached screenshot) we can see this a recursive answer meaning your DNS is doing
recursion to get the answer, then after getting it, the answer is kept in cache for a given time based on
record TTL value. So in any case if EIP DNS is saying ""NXDOMAIN"" that means he gets this answer from
another DNS when he did the recursion.

Action plan:

1. Please provide us with an answer about my colleague previous request (clear the cache as explained,
    do the query again and provide us with the command output

2. Please also try this one and provide us with the result:
    # dig @10.10.12.151 knowledgehub.josoorinstitute.qa +trace

We need to enable syslog on the existing DNS server. Please assist.

10.3.56.42 over port 514 UDP

Naseer",public,naser.khan@btc.com.bh
57164,312386,BATELCO (Bahrain Telecom),"Hello Naser,

Thank you for contacting EfficientIP support

You can enable the query log from GUI 

-Select the DNS server (not the SMART) --> Edit --> Command --> Querylog

Enabling query log will make the named.log rotate much faster because of the many log entries. Unless you are forwarding logs to an external log server to store the named.logs

To add a remote Syslog server:

-Go to the Administration tab. 
-In the menu, select Monitoring > Configuration of Network Logs.
-In the menu, select Add > Syslog configuration. 
-In the drop-down list Services, select the service (ipmserver, named or dhcpd) for which you want to redirect the logs.
-In the drop-down list Priority, set the redirection threshold through the logs severity levels.
-In the drop-down-list Type, the Network value is selected by default.
-In the field Target server, type in the IP address and port (e.g. 10.3.56.42:514) of the Syslog server you want the logs to be redirected to.
-Click on OK to commit your logs redirection.

For more information please refer to our administration guide "" chapter Monitoring"" - section ""To add a syslog redirection”

Since it’s not a critical production issue,  I will adjust the ticket priority accordingly.

0057578: (Fixed) [Security] Upgrade FreeBSD following CVE-2020-7469

So is v7.2.3 impacted for customers that don't use ICMPv6 or is there some functionality or discovery process that tries to ICMPv6 which could lead to a crash?
",public,rob_ingenthron@jabil.com
57664,315947,JABIL,"Hi Rob,

Thanks for contacting EfficientIP regarding CVE-2020-7469. As you mentioned it's a security patch that was implemented it does not not include any hot-fixes.

As you are not using ICMPv6 nor IPv6, there probably is no need for you to upgrade. Below are the details. I'm sure you have already read but I'll include in case it adds anything.

Problem Description:
When an ICMPv6 error message is received, the FreeBSD ICMPv6 stack
may extract information from the message to hand to upper-layer
protocols. As a part of this operation, it may parse IPv6 header
options from a packet embedded in the ICMPv6 message.
The handler for a routing option caches a pointer into the packet
buffer holding the ICMPv6 message. However, when processing
subsequent options the packet buffer may be freed, rendering the
cached pointer invalid. The network stack may later dereference the
pointer, potentially triggering a use-after-free.
Impact:
A remote host may be able to trigger a read of freed kernel memory.
This may trigger a kernel panic if the address had been unmapped.

Tim Gormley
